                <h3>New Healing</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>23 February 2024</small></small></em></p>  

<p>Is there another way, out past ways that were tried<br />
and retried, or is man eternally doomed to recur,<br />
like poor Echo, alone in his cave? I would like to think<br />
more things could be, that as old things were made,<br />
so could new things be made, and encouragement<br />
comes from the sun, which each morning endeavors<br />
to rise like before, but with just some small hint<br />
that the new day is new.  </p>

<p>About you, listen, it is not my place to tell you,<br />
but I will say anyway that dawn has awoken, and you<br />
remain stuck to your bed, eyes glued shut,<br />
but before long your hunger will drive you to wake<br />
and by then it will be far too late.  </p>

<p>Is there another dawn for stragglers, or will they<br />
be left all alone, to fight over the scraps,<br />
while the rest of the living world rises early<br />
to chase the first light and its offering?  </p>

<p>There will be time for repentance, be sure,<br />
but there will not be baths to make pure.  </p>

<p>I suspect it will come from the same place as always,<br />
that kernel of hope that men need for their labors,<br />
without which life pales when compared to its opposite,<br />
and which rests inevitably upon mere conformity,<br />
the group being group-like for its own sake.  </p>

<p>I cannot make this prettier, ugly as it is,<br />
and must be, for we spiritual beasts, always ready<br />
to rip and to tear those who differ, to secure for ourselves<br />
some asylum from loneliness. And yet it is we, the most lonesome,<br />
who persecute, in order to shape the whole world in our image,<br />
when perhaps they are fine as they are. I know not, know it well,<br />
and proclaim it to all who will hear. Is my doubt unappealing?<br />
Perhaps you will find that you too are in need of new healing.</p>
