                <h3>If I Yearn For More</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>23 February 2024</small></small></em></p>  

<p>The president stumbles, like so many times,<br />
in so many places. Is this what it looks like?<br />
The man, like his culture, stands pert at death's door.<br />
This has happened before, and to us, but how little we know.<br />
Is it back to the Gilded Age? Back to the old problem<br />
of starving farmers and captains of industry, presiding<br />
(please note the same word) over all. Who's in charge? Back<br />
before the Progressives intended to intervene, there was money,<br />
lots of it, but somehow not enough to go around.<br />
It's as old as Cain, like our president, these cycles of bust,<br />
the perennial bust of the workers, or so the Marxists say.<br />
But is this how a culture dies, or how one is born?<br />
Or both forever, interminable differences generating<br />
life and death? I don't know. I will never know.<br />
But I like to explore. It is good for the spirit<br />
(especially one at death's door) to be exercised. So far<br />
I've seen this president preside at death's door over<br />
his hearse and that of his century, but time will forgive me<br />
if I yearn for more.</p>
