<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>31 August 2022</small></small></em></p>  

<p>Once in awhile, despite expectations,<br />
you run into someone who knows what they're doing.<br />
Surprising in times like this, but then<br />
also familiar, as if in response to a call<br />
that you heard all along. It won't last,<br />
but for that moment you'll know what it means<br />
to be human. For that moment, all small<br />
uncertainties crystallize into a sculpture of rain,<br />
the most precious made permanent at last.<br />
But time chips at it, wears it away<br />
like a vandal, adolescent, without shame.<br />
You thought maybe it could be like before,<br />
when the stars spelled out stories of heroes<br />
and mankind obeyed and endured, but time<br />
had other plans. And then slowly a new thought<br />
emerged, not quite visible, but certainly there<br />
like a ship in the fog or an iceberg or<br />
some other sculpture. You thought, is this mine<br />
or must I wait for another? It has been<br />
so long since the last one, you thought of<br />
absconding whatever the terms. But this<br />
is not your ship, not your voyage. Your journey<br />
is here, where you are, on this ground.<br />
I had better remind you that ships come<br />
more often now, maybe the old way of choosing<br />
won't do, or at least, won't suffice.<br />
I must know where I stand, on the prow<br />
or on land, but in either case, these legs will do.<br />
So will yours. On the ship, watch the seamen<br />
so proud and hearty, assured of their<br />
artificial discipline. Of course this is mastery,<br />
of course this is justice, of course, of course.<br />
But the course is precisely neglected, already decided,<br />
not open to question. On land there are always<br />
new flowers. Who <em>we</em> are is never so certain.<br />
I like the land better, although I think men<br />
do learn something at sea, to tame chaos,<br />
a Faustian bargain if chaos is in us,<br />
if taken too far, but a call from the sky<br />
to those drowning in worlds without form.</p>
