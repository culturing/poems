                <h3>Industrial Man</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>21 July 2022</small></small></em></p>  

<p>When I survey Industrial Man<br />
in his anxious glory, his endless<br />
competitiveness, I still doubt<br />
that his station is final,<br />
that any part of his nature is fixed.<br />
If by now one knows not to assume<br />
that the spectre of Progress can save us,<br />
perhaps we can doubt, too, its wrath,<br />
which still animates workers,<br />
machine-like and futile,<br />
in cities all over the world.<br />
You have heard this before,<br />
but my question is different.<br />
It grows from a deeper uncertainty.<br />
Reason defies observation. The chaos<br />
is plain, and our planning has ended<br />
in time. So the wrath can be doubted,<br />
the wrath of the godless mind-in-the-sky<br />
who defies observation, whose wrath<br />
is our animus, naked and pure,<br />
like the God of before, without love,<br />
but that wrath drives its heart I am sure.  </p>

<p>There is something uncanny about reality,<br />
sitting out there in the ether,<br />
like a renegade neighbor,<br />
the kind that can never be trusted.<br />
Reality, too, can surprise<br />
even those with the best educations.<br />
I wonder what more it will say,<br />
once the moss has grown over broken traffic lights<br />
and deer play through shattered parking lots.<br />
It likes these places best, because less<br />
resists it there. Even here, where traffic flows,<br />
I can hear it call like the sound<br />
of bird-shot through tin, the eccentric neighbor<br />
readying himself for adventure.  </p>

<p>The machines never sleep, nor do we,<br />
being imitators of our environment,<br />
and somehow we have to compete,<br />
feeling threatened by gadgets<br />
that do it all better than we can,<br />
and so we assert our own dominance<br />
whenever we can. Apes that shove<br />
one another to the mud, the slow<br />
endless endeavor to be king of the hill,<br />
on a hill now maintained by machines<br />
bred by science in underground labs...<br />
Why is there no more <em>sunshine</em> here,<br />
in our minds, where in earlier times<br />
gentle breezes brought birdsong to bear<br />
on a plant's slow endeavor to blossom?  </p>
