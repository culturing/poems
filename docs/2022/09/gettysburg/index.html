<p>Before the dawn one evening, I went down<br />
to Jackson city, to remember why we here<br />
do not live there. It was a cool miseducation<br />
in the ways of segregation, but it was not<br />
what those elsewhere like to say. I saw a people,<br />
many hungry, some devoted, some misguided, one or two<br />
with hope to spare â€“ in other words, they were a people<br />
like the rest. True, they owned slaves, or those<br />
before them did, but this fact cannot be washed away<br />
with any amount of blood. We ought to know by now<br />
that history is fickle, and remains despite our sternest glare.<br />
There is no way to make it vanish. Nonetheless,<br />
we can move forward, and have done it, though<br />
with golden thread to bring us home. Have you observed<br />
how every poem stacked in order waits in reserve?<br />
They are like people under the lash of cold machines.<br />
Our words have suffered. They have lied to you,<br />
although they had no choice. The words are not<br />
the problem, though they are a symptom, and I hope by now<br />
you know the disease. I am at ease to write,<br />
it's true, but we are not at ease while living,<br />
and eternal life makes us less easy still. Before the dawn,<br />
consider what can still be spoken, and,<br />
more troublingly, think what can speak no more.<br />
It is the silence calling us this time of night.<br />
Beware the apathy of drowning in the noise.<br />
I hear the call of many chain-gangs in the wind.<br />
I hear their rattle, and they will not be ignored<br />
but seek no vengeance. They would like to sleep again<br />
and be released at last from pain. Could we oblige them?<br />
I think so, though it would take a serious effort<br />
and one not like what we've dared to try before.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>I do not believe in Lincoln. I cannot.<br />
He was a feckless Hegelian, couched in Biblical tones.<br />
He did not govern well. I've said it and will<br />
say it again, he cowed to violence, could not admit<br />
that states wished to secede. Oh, what a sneaky devil,<br />
blind in the face of the obvious. There is no forthcoming millennium<br />
where all peoples of all colors live as one. De Tocqueville<br />
said so. Yet we try and try and try. I do not know<br />
what else we could try, but we at least could notice the obvious,<br />
that humans are still human despite the violence.<br />
We are here, as we have always been, as prone to hate as love.<br />
It will not change. What wars are necessary to teach this once and for all?<br />
I fear the answer as I fear the blight of winter.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Why am I here, able neither to remember<br />
nor forget? To absorb solemnity left<br />
by dying men? Or to be thoughtful<br />
about how little we know? These men,<br />
brave men no doubt, died hard, but why?<br />
Should we dare also to die? Again? But why?  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Had Freedom died? Or was it just then mortally struck?<br />
Why was the new birth <em>necessary</em>, and could it be needed again?<br />
And needed by whom? I may digress, but you would not forgive<br />
serenity at a time like this, when lady liberty labors<br />
to bring life into the world. Would we, then, also<br />
be reborn? Some time ago was one, and yet<br />
another, who spoke hauntingly of birth. Where have they gone?<br />
Where have <em>we</em> gone? I think old freedom lives<br />
and could not be <em>re</em>born, for it was never born.<br />
It merely <em>is</em>, beyond the pale of all that ever<br />
comes to womb. It merely is, on its own terms,<br />
in its own time. Say Lincoln knew this.<br />
Likely he'd forgotten, like most others<br />
of his day, but say he knew it. Could we have<br />
a greater leader? Could mankind then rise past folly<br />
after all? Just say he knew it. Say he knew it<br />
for the scores of years of bloodshed we've endured.<br />
War is not pretty, no, but neither is our peace.<br />
The fools immortalize his words, against the wishes<br />
of those very words. I'd have this plaque removed,<br />
along with all the noisy monuments, and rather<br />
listen closely as the ghosts here tell their tale.</p>
