                <h3>The Hard Road In Between (Madonna/Whore)</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>21 February 2026</small></small></em></p>  

<p class='url' style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>https://poems.culturing.net/2026/02/the-hard-road-in-between-madonna-whore/</small></small></em></p>  

<p>I cannot determine if she<br />
is sweet and mildly repressed<br />
(with a few dark fantasies)<br />
or a succubus who likes to play naive.<br />
It's a winning strategy, if the goal<br />
is total desolation<br />
(for her more than anyone else).  </p>

<p>I suppose it would teach her father a lesson.<br />
Maybe I should leave them to it.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Nonetheless, Cupid deserves my praise.<br />
How can even a wicked girl summon strength?<br />
She cannot, but a god can, through the channels<br />
of imagination. I'm stronger now, but I fear<br />
she has only grown weaker.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Could she be a <em>recovering</em> succubus, who truly<br />
means it this time, but carries the old habits,<br />
the old desires? It's possible. Perhaps this fits the facts<br />
more than anything else...a Blanche DuBois<br />
to my Mitch, but that story doesn't end well for her...  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>It begins to make sense, if she is not repressed,<br />
but covert, hiding feelings and urges unfit for society.<br />
To what extent do these feelings control her?<br />
Perhaps a great deal. Does she know her way<br />
through a dimly lit room? Does she know it by heart?  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>It is none of my business, except in so far<br />
as it speaks to her character and capacity<br />
for healthy love. But I cannot decide a priori.<br />
I must step into this possible den of vipers,<br />
ensuring my routes of escape.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Of course the only possible truth is that<br />
she is both vamp and naif as the seasons permit.<br />
Has some man locked her into a spiral<br />
between Madonna and Whore? She could choose<br />
to be neither, and walk the hard road in between.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Another possibility: does she perceive her own wickedness<br />
in excess of the genuine article? Are these small naughty gestures<br />
not a confession of truth, but of misperception of herself<br />
as necessarily wicked because sexual by nature?<br />
I do not know what to call this if not repression.<br />
If so, then I hope she can find a better way, and learn<br />
that sex is a beautiful thing, if done right.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>What makes it "right" is a kind of respect<br />
for the animal in the other. But this begins<br />
with respect for the animal in oneself.</p>
