<p>But I will not walk away until I have finished<br />
telling you all I see. Thanks for lending an ear.<br />
It is a privilege to speak to one such as yourself,<br />
so attentive and eager to please. But did you not<br />
pick up on my irony? Were you too busy gorging<br />
on praise? It was poisoned, my love, all along,<br />
and now you have digested so much of it<br />
I fear for your health more than mine.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>It seems we were playing the same game<br />
or at most half-playing, if you read<br />
between the lines. You were never more<br />
than a dream, the incarnation of a misreading<br />
of my words, or an actual dream in my mind.<br />
But that dream lives on and prospers<br />
no matter your fate.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>You have stared into the abyss, and now<br />
the abyss is at home in you, slowly growing,<br />
dissolving your organs, devouring what remains<br />
of a heart which I still maintain is not <em>wholly</em> bad,<br />
but more bad than good by the looks of things.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Did you think I would never notice, or that<br />
it would come as a surprise that some women play games?<br />
You have left enough clues to prove that you are such a woman,<br />
and I had a hunch from the first. But I asked for a ride<br />
nonetheless, and I mostly enjoyed it. It's a pity,<br />
I really might have loved you, had the terms been better.</p>
