<p>Do you see now? The girl who once misunderstood<br />
the lascivious glares of men, the cruel jokes and vulgar gestures,<br />
who did not know that these things were not done in sport<br />
but grow out of the ugly, urgent need for ugly, urgent souls to make manifest<br />
their ugliness, exposing the darkness within. Has this girl<br />
been replaced by one who sees clearly herself and her place in a world<br />
run by wolves? This is no place for innocence. Oh,<br />
she would like to grow up...will it cost her<br />
herself? She would be a prized commodity in some circles,<br />
at least until her innocence dies. Is there another way?<br />
Yes and no. The world is what it is, and mankind is too.<br />
She would find in herself a response to the degradation,<br />
the ugliest sweetness, the darkest love. It would scare her, and thrill her,<br />
and ultimately leave her unsatisfied. But never again would she trust<br />
so willingly, never again give her heart without proper conditions.<br />
What are those conditions? Respect, first and foremost, for darkness<br />
and its place in our lives. For the evils above are mere phony expressions<br />
of energies that animate all of us, powering human endeavors<br />
and making us want to live. To kill those energies would kill us too.<br />
But the suitable objects for dreams of desire or domination<br />
are always within the context of social order, on which we depend.<br />
Any creature that does not so depend can hardly deserve the name "human."<br />
The darkness can neither be killed nor fully embraced, but it can<br />
be integrated into a dance between light and shadow, a chiaroscuro<br />
that gives men and women real strength.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Not only could you be made a slave, you could be made<br />
to like it, to see yourself suited and suitable to degradation only<br />
and nothing more. Something like this (though a pale imitation)<br />
occurs in many failed loves. It is vital, beyond vital,<br />
that you remain strong, that you love yourself,<br />
that you care for your body and spirit, and simply refuse<br />
any invitations to lower yourself below strength,<br />
no matter the offer. It will not be easy,<br />
but that is why it is worth it. Thereby you will prove<br />
that you cannot be beaten down, that the power within you<br />
is real and a force to be reckoned with.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>But you also must offer only this same strength to others,<br />
and not use your strength to deprive them of theirs. The fight<br />
is to carve out a slice of the earth where your strength can shine<br />
against darkness within and without, and in this fight you may find<br />
some allies pursuing the same. But they will not allow you to lower them.<br />
You will do better to let them be, because they will return the favor.<br />
The wolves can be kept at bay, but only from this posture of strength.<br />
No other posture has ever had any effect.</p>
