                <h3>House of the Dead III</h3>

<p>Can I really descend once more into the house of the dead?<br />
Can I really become a ghost again, and traipse my way<br />
among corpses, forever adrift from the dying sun? Isis came,<br />
and I should not have doubted, but why did she come?<br />
Did she love, or did she merely want <em>me</em> to love?<br />
To what purpose? To satisfy vanity, or maybe<br />
to trigger growth, but the latter so closely <em>resembles</em> love<br />
that I can't tell the difference. She put so much into it,<br />
then stopped at a certain point, and plateaued.<br />
This is no longer reciprocity, no longer evenly efforted.<br />
<em>Was</em> it a trick? Was it not Isis at all, but some god<br />
of deception, insulting me all the way? I have been mocked<br />
back into living form, that's truth enough, and this prophecy<br />
from years ago has come to pass. Although it did not last,<br />
it held my face to a glass in which I see myself reflected<br />
as a man who can do better, who deserves better, than phony love,<br />
the art of loose and playful women. Sure, she knows how to read,<br />
and that is rare enough, but if the heart is not tied to this skill,<br />
then I will walk free, I will not bend the knee to a harlot<br />
who truly deserves no such love. To have glimpsed her is enough,<br />
even if a mirage from the sands of Egypt, even if she meant harm.<br />
She has caused me grief but not so much grief that I am not stronger for it.<br />
I doubt that she will ever reveal her hand, nor can I decipher<br />
her intentions from a morass of clues. So it's time to move on.<br />
But I will not return to the house of the dead. I will live,<br />
in the sun, for the rest of my days.</p>
