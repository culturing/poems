                <h3>Cruelty II</h3>

<p>On second thought, my thoughts turn away,<br />
toward healthier fields. Three times now you have devalued my suit<br />
in the midst of mixed signals. Three times may be enough<br />
to establish a pattern. I have told you I do not find you<br />
unworthy of love, but unbridled cruelty might change that,<br />
at least in the short term,<br />
even if it wears a mask. It was never the cruelty<br />
that bound me to you. There was something else,<br />
something wonderful, and I still remember it, in fact<br />
I still <em>see</em> it, but the picture is complicated now.<br />
I wanted to wish away these slights<br />
as the clumsy confusion of naivete, but maybe<br />
you know <em>exactly</em> what you're doing, and maybe<br />
this backhanded cruelty is a form of survival<br />
in a world that won't let you be cruel outright.<br />
Well, I see it at least, but the sight of it<br />
moves my heart out of orbit. There is no decision<br />
to make, I fear the thing has accomplished itself.<br />
I wish you safe passage, as I did from the start,<br />
and I think you have much to accomplish in life<br />
and will accomplish it. I have no regrets.<br />
The sight of you woke in me something<br />
that never will slumber again, the dream of an "us"<br />
that transcends the sum of its parts. I hold onto that dream,<br />
and I hope you will too.<br />
But you are not my responsibility. I will keep writing,<br />
but you may do well to stop reading. It will likely<br />
be bittersweet at best. It has been a pleasure<br />
almost knowing you. Now, to rest.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Is it cruelty, or is it the perception of cruelty?<br />
So much depends on the answer...or is it what I asked for,<br />
quite literally? A love that is not "pure or chaste"?<br />
I had not thought you could make that leap so suddenly<br />
or so completely. Please be careful. Make sure<br />
you understand, and build this new self slowly. Get the foundation<br />
right, and don't throw away the old one until you have something<br />
to take its place. But I hear you. You're willing to leap.<br />
That means a great deal. But you leap, and then subvert.<br />
That means something too.</p>
