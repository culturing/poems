<p>Have I imagined you? Suddenly I feel once again<br />
as if figments of dreams have become something real...<br />
have I lost the thread that leads out of the maze,<br />
to the trail of breadcrumbs that I myself laid?<br />
Are you cruel? Are you kind? Are you both?<br />
I have not had the chance to know, but these signals,<br />
if merely a shadow game, would be cruel.<br />
I have stayed in the hope they were something more.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>On the other hand, it remains possible<br />
that you are a narcissist, enticing my love<br />
for the sake of mockery or to teach me some lesson.<br />
Is that your purpose? If so, you are strangely<br />
committed to it. If so, we can drop the charade.<br />
Consider my lesson learned, the lesson<br />
that love, if done right,<br />
is invigorating...even with a careless partner.<br />
But once they are shown to be careless,<br />
it's better to leave them alone.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>It would have been nice to know you,<br />
but if you have made your choice,<br />
then I must make mine.  </p>

<p>If my words have meant something to you,<br />
keep them,<br />
but don't ask for more.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Yet I can't believe that you're Vanda,<br />
or, if you are, that it's not just a phase.<br />
Is that really the "love" you prefer?<br />
You know better.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Must you try on black to darken the hue of appalling white?<br />
Must you go to extremes just to find the center?<br />
If <em>this</em> is your purpose, to heal, I commend you,<br />
but witness the danger. It's what will save you<br />
from the trap of darkness. Catch sight<br />
of the path that leads home, the path<br />
with a panoply of colors, with lights along the way.</p>
