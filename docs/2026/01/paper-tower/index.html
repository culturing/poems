                <h3>Paper Tower</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>18 January 2026</small></small></em></p>

<p>She sits at the center of her tower in prayer.<br />
She was given no door, no furniture, no plants,<br />
nothing living and thus no temptation. She sits<br />
and she waits for she knows not what. As the hours<br />
creep by, she grows restless, begins to examine the walls,<br />
to touch them even, and finds them not stone as she thought,<br />
but the image of stone imprinted on the thinnest paper.<br />
A devilish thought overtakes her. She taps the paper<br />
and watches it wave the whole wall up and down,<br />
as far as the eye can see. So she pushes it harder.<br />
A small tear brings in fresh air. She falls back,<br />
so used to the dank of the tower that freshness,<br />
with who knows what pollen, comes in as a shock.<br />
But before long she stands by this tear and its offering,<br />
breathing as deeply as she can. She tears it still further<br />
and further, until she can see the other side. She's amazed.<br />
She just stands there for days, in a daze at the wonders<br />
of plants and birds, the sun and the breeze,<br />
but she will not leave the tower. It's home,<br />
and all homes have value. But something<br />
was ever unsettled. She knows about trees now,<br />
and she was not one to forget. Why were there no trees<br />
in her tower, no birds, no songs? One day she gazes out<br />
and sees a tree struck by lightning catch fire,<br />
and she cannot stay in any longer. She rushes to it,<br />
climbing and climbing to the highest branches, where the fire burns.<br />
She tries to grasp it, unaware of such things, unlearned<br />
in the ways of fire. She feels its burn and screams.<br />
As the scream leaves, some pieces of fire enter through her<br />
and settle deep within. She has fire in her now, and she thinks<br />
of the paper that was once her home, and she thinks<br />
that all paper is made from trees, and if trees can burn...<br />
She returns to her tower and dares not touch the walls<br />
with burning hands. She sits quieter than ever, dead center,<br />
not sure how to pray anymore. But the fire keeps on burning.<br />
She does not mean to, but soon her heat expands and ignites the walls<br />
in a holocaust of flame, as she weeps all alone at the center.<br />
But the blaze cannot hurt her. It <em>is</em> her, and she was not meant<br />
for this tower. She burns and burns and eventually<br />
she stops weeping. She rises and goes to the original tear.<br />
She sees something written that calms the flame. What was it?<br />
A map of some islands in the Aegean? A few lines of poetry?<br />
The words of a long-dead philosopher? Whatever it was, she knows now<br />
that the walls had been made from things meant to move.<br />
So she goes out in search of a place where her fire can burn.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>She doesn't find one, not for a long time, and she feels<br />
the danger of hunger, the pang of thirst. She returns to the tower<br />
and papers over paper with paper. She puts out her fire,<br />
or tries to...at least she manages to heal and dwell<br />
with some potted plants and a bit of dancing.<br />
But this is no longer a home for her, if it ever was.<br />
She needs another to knock on her door.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>He came with a torch and instructions on how to use it.<br />
He knew the way to a place where all fire is admired.<br />
He offered to show her and waited until she was ready.  </p>

<p>They went together.<br />
Some say they lived happily ever after.</p>
