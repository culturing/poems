                <h3>Eccentricities</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>01 January 2026</small></small></em></p>  

<p class='url' style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>https://poems.culturing.net/2026/01/eccentricities/</small></small></em></p>  

<p>I know that you changed the words.<br />
I think I know where you got the new ones.<br />
I know what that would mean.<br />
You know you can <em>tell me</em> if you want to.<br />
I think I want to. I would tell you too.<br />
I don't find you strange, or at least<br />
I don't find you unworthy of love.<br />
I would show you how worthy you are.<br />
I would call you strong and brave.<br />
I would tell you until you believe me.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>It doesn't have to be a walk in the park.<br />
It could be an experiment, designed to trigger growth.<br />
There are two kinds of not being ready.<br />
The first is unable to try.<br />
The second can try and learn by trying and, thus, get ready.<br />
It can be hard to tell these two things apart.<br />
It's better to err on the side of caution.<br />
But sometimes the growth has already begun<br />
and must be seen through, given space to grow,<br />
or else it becomes a cancer.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Shall I apologize for giving you space to grow?<br />
It almost seems necessary. It has not been painless.<br />
But I think I shall not. I think you will thank me too.<br />
Still, love is not built on pain. I wish you quick healing,<br />
but not so quick as to leave the work undone.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>I believe I have seen this performance before,<br />
or one like it. The delivery indeed is "strange".<br />
It's unique to you, but some parts of this take are new.<br />
Could it be you have weaved a tapestry<br />
of me and you into something you hold very dear?<br />
The resemblance is striking, this character <em>is</em> you,<br />
or close enough that her words are like a totem.  </p>

<p>If so, then what is your vow? How will you satisfy<br />
the need that emerges painfully? It does not end well for Alma.<br />
That does not mean it can't end well for you. But be careful.<br />
Take care of yourself, of your heart, of your body.<br />
These treasures, once lost, can be hard to recover.<br />
But you may indeed be obliged to risk them on the road to experience.<br />
Only you know. You must do what you have to do.</p>
