<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>25 January 2026</small></small></em></p>  

<p class='url' style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>https://poems.culturing.net/2026/01/presence/</small></small></em></p>  

<p>I must see that you are ready to be a woman<br />
before I could ask you to be <em>my</em> woman,<br />
and I must see it in person and not in character.<br />
I thought you thought you were ready and was nearly ready to ask before.<br />
I suppose you must see that I am also ready to be a man.<br />
We could prove it together.<br />
But I can't shake the feeling that you are only <em>almost</em> ready.<br />
Prove me wrong.<br />
Appear with the grace and confidence that I know you can also imagine.<br />
Invite me into your presence.<br />
I will not break down the door.<br />
But I will enter if you open it.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>But maybe the door is stuck, jammed<br />
with memories and bruises. Even so, I maintain<br />
that it only opens inward. I cannot help clear it from outside.<br />
You must clear the way to let me in. Only then<br />
could I help, and I would help, with feeling.<br />
But I have not the power nor the inclination<br />
to break down doors, and I think you would find<br />
that life with no door is far worse than the life you have now.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>You can choose to let me in, even for wild reasons,<br />
to set free a wildness within. It is true, I have known doorbreakers<br />
and the allure of barging in. But I surrender that power<br />
in the name of something higher, a love which awaits invitations<br />
and happy news. You must keep your door, for without it you would be exposed<br />
to the worst kind of monster, a man in heat. You must keep your door,<br />
with a fresh handle, clear of obstructions, but locked<br />
until the time of your choosing.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>It would not take much, I could squeeze through<br />
even a narrow opening, and begin the work<br />
of sorting things out. What matters is the intent,<br />
the respect for doors and locks, without which<br />
you place yourself in grave danger. Perhaps I fibbed<br />
when I said that I have not the power to break down doors.<br />
I do have it, but I will not use it, because it would hurt you,<br />
perhaps for a long time afterward. You have a power too,<br />
that of opening and closing, and I would like to see you wield it<br />
as a woman in full command of her presence.</p>
