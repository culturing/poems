                <h3>Feeling Dry (A Pain From Long Ago)</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>27 January 2026</small></small></em></p>

<p>I'm reminded of another pain from long ago,<br />
one not yet put into words. She was too young too,<br />
but all I wanted was to encourage. She sat apart from the others,<br />
reading Shakespeare, and I could understand how a mind like hers<br />
would crave solitude and find her world depressing.<br />
It was my role to encourage, like Jesus would,<br />
and it almost ruined my life. Her mother misunderstood<br />
and accused me to my face of vulgar intentions.<br />
No father was in the picture, and I can assume<br />
the mother had reasons to mistrust men on sight. Even so,<br />
false accusations could have haunted me, followed me,<br />
if the story had reached the news. So what could I do<br />
but walk away, and leave this poor girl more discouraged<br />
than before. I could have helped her, and no, not with sex,<br />
but with <em>words</em> and kindness, the kind she was lacking,<br />
the kind that her mother kept hidden from her. But my own life<br />
imperiled, I fled, and I do not regret it, though I am ashamed<br />
that I did not defend my honor. But there was no use.<br />
Even false accusations destroy. And what man can stand<br />
against pain, plain and simple, when put on display?  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>This was my final break with Christianity.<br />
I tried to love my neighbor and it cost me dearly.<br />
Never again. Does my neighbor <em>want</em> to be loved, and by a stranger?<br />
These teachings of love I now find vile.<br />
Greet one another with a holy kiss? No thank you.<br />
The teachings of Jesus, if put into practice, would overturn<br />
everything, bad and good. But they never were put into practice,<br />
and if they were, it would ruin the family, it would be like a shooting star<br />
burning out as soon as it started, because the foundation is shaky,<br />
rooted in weakness instead of strength. No, all Christian churches<br />
require an admixture of Greek and Roman ideals<br />
to have any staying power. That is my final answer.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>I turn now to you, muse of many poems, mercurial<br />
sprite of the night of the pigtails, and ask: does my violent reaction<br />
make sense now? You are older than this friend was long ago,<br />
but you are younger than she is now. Does that feel gross? I do not know.<br />
Perhaps the span of years matters less than absolute maturity,<br />
and if you are ready, then you are ready, but I will be very careful,<br />
more careful than needed, because this friend may have thought<br />
she was ready for something beyond her years, inspiring her mother's worry.<br />
I do not know what role I played in her life, if any,<br />
but despite my own confusion and immaturity, my conscience is clear.<br />
I intended to help her. But I would do more than help you.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Can you swallow this, digest it, then live with it?<br />
I have no choice, but you could walk away<br />
and plant your flag in other soil, in even<br />
the soil that I have rejected. Make your choice, but take your time.<br />
I could convince you that the ground I have found is fertile.<br />
I could show you how things grow and why.<br />
But I know that the cost is high.<br />
So look to the sky, and answer.<br />
Are you feeling dry?  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Am I to be crucified for caring about the soul of another?<br />
Whence comes this hysteria, the fear that all caring means sex<br />
and that sex is expressly forbidden, until a certain age?<br />
Shall adolescence be loveless? Who could defend such absurdity?<br />
Of <em>course</em> they must try and err, that is the whole purpose<br />
of growing up, and of course it gets messy, confusing,<br />
with even a hint of danger. But are we so weak<br />
that this danger must cause us to panic, or are we men and women<br />
intent on raising the next generation to maturity? There is<br />
no easy path, free from danger, there is only this <em>one</em> path<br />
or standing still, and still-standing turns into despair every time.<br />
I have no wish to sanction abusers or give them aid or comfort,<br />
but there are other kinds of abuse perpetuated in the name<br />
of abolishing abuse, and I will not sanction these either. Some risks<br />
must be taken, as young people know all too well. But feeling,<br />
after all, is not action, and sometimes the risk of allowing a feeling<br />
is enough, to let it pass through the body and fade into vapor.<br />
Self-discipline is not some myth, unreachable and naive, it is<br />
the only path to a fulfilling life, and too much external discipline<br />
prevents its development, inhibits the growth of executive functioning<br />
in those who have this potential. The line remains blurry,<br />
for try as we might, who can say when experience crosses over<br />
from good into bad? Is it not always both? But sometimes<br />
it's more one than the other...  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>There was no sex, and there would not have been any sex.<br />
But there were erotic feelings, on her part at least. Perhaps I was foolish<br />
to not see the danger, though I maintain the danger<br />
was overstated, perhaps even necessary for her. She was trying<br />
to develop, and surely we all would be better off<br />
if more people grew up. But can I be trusted to maintain<br />
a safe distance? If I erred, it was hubris, not lust.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Strange to remember these long-dead memories<br />
on the cusp of my own maturity. Perhaps I see now<br />
what I sensed then as mere potential, the end of the growth<br />
that begins when a suitable partner appears. She was trying,<br />
and I cannot fault her for that, any more than I fault myself<br />
for wishing her well. But the pain of the tyranny of undeveloped people,<br />
who assume no development is possible, that questions are fruitless,<br />
that growth and adulthood are myths enforced by power and violence<br />
rather than real achievements...such people will ruin us, if we let them.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>But part of the problem lies deep in the Christian idea of love,<br />
of a love so pure and chaste that no danger can overcome it.<br />
What evils await those who attempt to embody such love!<br />
Whether the universe loves in this way, <em>we</em> do not, and we must not<br />
attempt it. Our love is contingent, reciprocal, full of expectations<br />
and mutual recriminations. So was this my folly, to attempt<br />
unidirectional love, like the so-called love of God, a love free<br />
from human needs and confusions, a love built on lies? And this love,<br />
as we know well by now, is despotic, mere tyranny in disguise.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>But absent such love, what remains of the church?<br />
Some hard fragments of Roman law and a flowering of Greek philosophy,<br />
maybe the playful wink of Plotinus or the warm-hearted empathy of Jesus,<br />
but not the doctrines, no theologies, because the central pillar is rotten, the very idea<br />
of God's one-sided love is repugnant upon examination. For who among us<br />
could reciprocate the love of God? Does this teaching not teach us<br />
to deny our volition in the face of irresistible love?<br />
No wonder abusers find a home in the church!<br />
Their victims are primed in advance to receive the abuse<br />
of a love that denies their autonomy. I will have none of this love. I will not.<br />
And my heart will be healthier, even if I must go alone.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>But must I go alone? I can see now over the horizon<br />
one approaching my lonely encampment, who perhaps has felt these things before.<br />
I would welcome you, but you must count the cost of rejecting<br />
much of what shaped you. Perhaps you reject it already. Perhaps<br />
that's what brings us together. But you know my heart. I reveal it<br />
so you may decide for yourself who you are<br />
and whether you wish to go with me.</p>
