                <h3>Whatever The Numbers Say</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>13 January 2026</small></small></em></p>

<p>The leader knows nothing, he babbles like an idiot<br />
about how we must "align motions," then exiles or punishes<br />
those who disagree. This is no way to motivate. Now<br />
we shall sacrifice honor, hard won over many years,<br />
to assuage the ego of an insecure man. He must change things<br />
or else he could never take credit, and some in the group were too virtuous<br />
to be swayed. So away with them! Bring in old friends<br />
who may or may not be better, who certainly will be more loyal<br />
to a man who needs all the loyalty he can get, unable<br />
to earn it the hard and true way. Will the ship stay afloat?<br />
It seems less and less likely, though most of the crew<br />
are experienced at sea and can see the storms coming. One hopes<br />
for a mutiny, perhaps from above, from those pulling the strings,<br />
under whose banner all our ships sail. But it may be<br />
that honor is profitable only for so long, that eventually growth<br />
is an end in itself, once the victims no longer can escape.<br />
Have we spun a neat web for them, made from false promises<br />
and years of good treatment, such that now they will stay either way?<br />
Shall we make leaving hard, then abuse them? Such is the way<br />
to ruin, whatever the numbers say.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Time will tell, but for now I am loyal to those I have seen do good<br />
over many years. It will be a sight to see if new evil collides<br />
with old good, entrenched and habitual, but lacking executive support.<br />
It's the old cosmic struggle. But how could I leave, knowing<br />
nowhere is free from this struggle forever, that virtue breeds growth<br />
and that growth breeds corruption, now and forevermore?</p>
