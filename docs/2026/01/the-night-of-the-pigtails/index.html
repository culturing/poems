                <h3>The Night of the Pigtails</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>22 January 2026</small></small></em></p>

<p>You seemed very young (far too young<br />
if you know what I mean), and I hardly could recognize<br />
the glimpse of the woman I knew I had seen.<br />
But I felt a strange warmth even so. I chose<br />
not to approach, and in fact was quite worried<br />
I might have hallucinated, desperate as I was for any sign.<br />
For your presence there made all the difference.<br />
But what was this girlish slough, these pigtails?<br />
I think I can understand your need for reconnaissance,<br />
but I had to consider the latent aggression,<br />
the taunt enclosed in such a move amid silence,<br />
after what we had been through. Perhaps I deserved it<br />
for waking desire. Or perhaps it tested my courage<br />
and strength. Did I pass? I did not like being taunted, and told you<br />
in so many words, but those words were prepared in advance,<br />
in response to the silence, and had a secret meaning.<br />
I understood also that <em>you</em> were sorry, only sorry<br />
that we failed to connect, for reasons still unknown to me.<br />
But neither of us was sorry the attempt had been made.<br />
And now as we approach what may be a second attempt,<br />
I must wonder if the way has cleared, the storm has passed,<br />
and the slough has been shed once and for all.<br />
Has the Night of the Pigtails faded into myth?</p>
