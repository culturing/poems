                <h3>The House of the Dead</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>28 July 2023</small></small></em></p>  

<p>He had only begun to understand<br />
when lightning came to slice the branch<br />
clean off the bough. It wouldn't matter anyhow<br />
without her or the scent of her still lingering<br />
as though to ask a question though afraid.<br />
It wouldn't matter, as all ages past can fail<br />
to mean a thing, unlike the scent of one<br />
familiar flesh, though this place houses souls.<br />
I ask for a friend what purpose has redemption<br />
after love, for who regrets the love? The pain,<br />
indeed regrettable, will satisfy Osiris, who,<br />
by any other name, enlists the dead<br />
into the legions of sweet peril, lost<br />
in strife, lest loss of love revive their ire.<br />
Tell me, Pharaoh, whether any Isis waits<br />
to mock the dead back into living forms?  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Come again, sweet spirit, to my chamber,<br />
whence these dreams enlist the tumult<br />
of the darkened days of man<br />
to find what gems were left behind<br />
beneath the pile of burning coals.<br />
Come and wander to the bottom<br />
whence death carries all who dare,<br />
but do take care -- you are not one of them<br />
just yet. I ask your help. This excavation<br />
will take years, and we have time to sit and chat<br />
about what might have been. I'll tell you,<br />
there are many things to learn, but few to love,<br />
and by that God who lives above one suffers bitterly,<br />
but what is to be done remains obscure.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Perhaps begin by thinking on new avenues,<br />
then stopping to inquire why these structures, why this order.<br />
But do not be late for dinner, which revives you,<br />
like the hero back from Lethe in the dream of old,<br />
for this is where hope lies. We are in chains, it has been said,<br />
but now with sun-parched eyes we look again and see<br />
the cave itself in motion, hurling madly through the void.<br />
Will all things be destroyed? And are the chains themselves<br />
our safety during impact? How much Freedom does a man need?<br />
And who else could do our work, and do it well?  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Come let us mock the automatons<br />
and the free spirits, with equal measure.</p>
