                <h3>In the Field</h3>

<p>As I survey my field, I remember<br />
how last season's crop came up fallow.<br />
The soil has had no time to heal<br />
and the seed is exhausted and shallow.<br />
I know what I have to do now,<br />
though it pains me to look on the barren<br />
and doubt that here ever could grow<br />
something worthy of effort. But pain<br />
could be pain of new birth, not this field<br />
or this labor, but pain from some far away effort<br />
to find a new field and to build a hearth near it<br />
where children could play in the morning<br />
and old men retire at evening,<br />
but children would notice the dearth of the field<br />
of the hollow seed, and would surely have questions<br />
as I, gazing blankly at Nothing, remain<br />
unresponsive. Oh well, it was nice as a dream,<br />
though the field and myself are the same,<br />
and though nothing has changed,<br />
I must gaze at it, penetrating<br />
into some essence not well understood or explained,<br />
like an artist, but not like a rabid one,<br />
waiting for what's there to speak. Of this field<br />
I know nothing, hear nothing, and therefore<br />
expect to grow nothing. It's always this way<br />
with such fields, which were not well maintained,<br />
though it happens in even good fields.<br />
I do not tell my neighbor what to do with his field,<br />
and I ask for the same in return,<br />
but in my case, I'll know when my field has run dry<br />
not to hope it will grow if I try.</p>
