                <h3>Ready For Change</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>23 November 2023</small></small></em></p>  

<p class='url' style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>https://poems.culturing.net/2023/11/ready-for-change/</small></small></em></p>  

<p>Sunrise, after a long doubt, and<br />
our journey resumes, the one started before<br />
stars were named, toward Ashtoreth, maybe<br />
toward some Valhalla, but certainly ours,<br />
here and now. In this legacy, sorcerers<br />
fail to revive, and time passes, as always.<br />
If only the stars would align, like before,<br />
when hope meant something, mankind could rise<br />
and be sure, but our stars float awry,<br />
too disturbed by each other<br />
to fly or to guide human eyes.  </p>

<p>--   </p>

<p>Is it Dawn, and if so, does she come<br />
from the East, or have we been deceived<br />
for long ages about where hope dwells,<br />
what hope is? In the East, Magi<br />
suffer oppression, and others toil on,<br />
so what dawn could they bring here,<br />
where stars have stopped shining out meaning?<br />
What dawn...further east, in Kung-Fu Tzse's house,<br />
now the master is homeless, his unfilial children<br />
rejecting his lessons in favor of permanent revolution.<br />
Not here, no, keep looking...  </p>

<p>When Dawn comes, it comes with a bang,<br />
but it leaves with a whimper,<br />
as previously observed,<br />
but this time is so different, so new!<br />
Are there flowers? And why?<br />
When it comes it just comes of its own accord.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>What is <em>future</em>? What <em>history</em>?<br />
If not just a mallet for striking one's enemies,<br />
if really a there-to-behold, even now, in potentia,<br />
the newborn first imitating father and mother,<br />
then leaving the den to seek out its own place<br />
among stars, among earth, with the words that were spoken<br />
remembered and cherished, together with others<br />
together for now, then apart, then forgotten,<br />
but living throughout and within the tradition<br />
which echoes with words, with new words, always new,<br />
to remark what has been for posterity.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>The newness of the day can cancel Nothing,<br />
see the self-negating spirit succeed<br />
and rid us of itself, with final vigor.<br />
No more piddling doubts or quibbling with the self,<br />
no more self-criticism or phony dialectics,<br />
only learning, only growing through surprise (there is<br />
no other way), and only strong souls daring thought<br />
(all others knowing thought is not their cause).<br />
Then free from terror, free from all the machinations<br />
of the empty revolutions, but still freer of what came before,<br />
we'll build, and start from Nothing, if we must,<br />
for 'tis with Nothing that our forbears stopped,<br />
and we go further, on into the formless cold<br />
of space eternal, warped by dreams of grids<br />
and all false representing symbols, such that<br />
we can actually believe we've mastered time,<br />
and that, like space, it is a thing of grids<br />
and not the source of mysteries and growth.  </p>

<p>Enough of this, it has been said,<br />
but let me urge you one more time,<br />
pray do not fall for all you're told,<br />
despite the grandeur of the teller.<br />
But don't be a doubter-on-command.<br />
That is no better.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>The point, the point...there must have been one,<br />
how else could we live, without purposes, lacking design?<br />
Yet we've failed to find it now time after time.<br />
So what sacred remains from the astral pyre<br />
await some old reinvigoration? The rough beasts<br />
have all come and gone, their day dies,<br />
and the new day is dawning, this time<br />
with less obstinance, no absolutes, and a people<br />
born ready for change.</p>
