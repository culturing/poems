<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>26 April 2023</small></small></em></p>  

<p>Stillborn I fell through the silence of water<br />
past life-forms and fishes uncouth to my eyes<br />
and descended, awakening once more in Asia,<br />
no longer afraid. She was cunning and charming<br />
but little did I know she'd tempt me<br />
to give myself up for her dream, that that dream<br />
was the flower of five-thousand years. What was I<br />
in her thrall? Just a subject of political<br />
experimentation, unburdened of freedom, near dead<br />
with remorse or from absence of light. I would<br />
counter with energy pure from the true well<br />
of Hellas, or if this too sickens, then<br />
out of the well of humanity, some substance comes.<br />
And I take it and groan at the weight of it,<br />
knowing though that such is mine, throughout time,<br />
and that only tomorrow will tell what we do here<br />
but I for one lend time my hand and my ear,<br />
and by this you will know me, for this is my sign,<br />
this remembrance of time in its service despite<br />
the loud claims that all clocks are manmade<br />
and need manual winding. My silence<br />
speaks volumes against these blasphemers,<br />
who never could wait, think, or speak.</p>
