                <h3>Bones (How Things Stand)</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>29 October 2023</small></small></em></p>  

<p class='url' style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>https://poems.culturing.net/2023/10/bones-how-things-stand/</small></small></em></p>  

<p>Someone must put into words how things stand,<br />
not to silence the critics or win some shallow victory,<br />
but only to make ourselves clear -- who we are<br />
and why -- because when we are gone, there must be<br />
some memento. Our children deserve that much, and more,<br />
and although we are sure that we know what we know,<br />
they will doubt it, so someone must put into words<br />
how things stand, for they <em>do</em> stand, by miracle, time after time.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Or is the miracle within us after all?<br />
These are difficult questions, but good ones.<br />
One wonders whether in the final analysis<br />
the children's children will look on their grandparents<br />
with pity, as toward a girl who has had an abusive father<br />
who fears that all men are abusive. Is all government<br />
bloodthirsty? Or have we just deep collective wounds<br />
from some prior injustices, burned in our memories? Caligula,<br />
what a monster, and don't forget Nero, and of course<br />
there were Hitler and Stalin...  </p>

<p>At some point the prophecy fulfills itself.<br />
We get more of the things we attend to.<br />
The war against tyranny ensures more tyranny.<br />
Whence comes the miracle?  </p>

<p>From somewhere within, or maybe somewhere without,<br />
but its origin means less than its presence.<br />
It comes.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Virtue comes and goes, there's a new thought,<br />
and whether you think it or not, it occurs,<br />
the proverbial tree in the forest that makes a sound,<br />
though the sound is ourselves, though nobody has ears to hear it.<br />
It's what they call Spirit, although it is also<br />
much more than that. It may live in our bones<br />
and our ancestors' bones, and whatever their phobias,<br />
whatever their misguided fancies, those phobias<br />
guide us as instinct and intuition, the memory<br />
of thousands of years of trial and error<br />
with occasional insight, recorded through joy and through exaltation<br />
in the bodies of those who live through it.  </p>

<p>Why do we show such respect for old bones<br />
if it's not because bones house the past,<br />
and deep down we suspect that our present<br />
will one day in total be bones?<br />
Could it be that things stand on their bones,<br />
that the boneless are formless, sans history,<br />
without any direction or purpose?</p>
