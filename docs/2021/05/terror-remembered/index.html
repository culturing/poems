<p>I.  </p>

<figure>  
    <blockquote>To make us love our country, our country ought to be lovely.</blockquote>  
    <figcaption>Edmund Burke, <cite>Reflections on the Revolution in France</cite></figcaption>  
</figure>  

<p>We who have known terror must know love,<br />
from the hearts of those who died and killed,<br />
from the souls they willed to live,<br />
and from the dreams that spilled<br />
on every bloodstained street<br />
while we with banners blazing terror<br />
forgot love.  </p>

<p>We must know of love<br />
if we are ever to forgive ourselves,<br />
or ever to again lift up those banners<br />
which to many once meant hope,<br />
and still mean something (this, here, now,<br />
is where old plants become new soil)<br />
and with this toil we must know love,<br />
this loving toil of generations,<br />
for the burden never lessens<br />
but the joy arrives with spring.  </p>

<p>We who know of terror<br />
must plant love in fields<br />
once sown with mortal error,<br />
and if joy comes in the morning<br />
it will shock us,<br />
but we must not let it stop us.  </p>

<p>Joy is the reminder<br />
that all things, from nothing, journey thence,<br />
and we who have known terror<br />
must know joyful toiling love.  </p>

<p>Enough of burning buildings,<br />
and enough of bloody deserts.  </p>

<p>We know love.<br />
We will not live for less again.  </p>

<p>II.  </p>

<figure>  
    <blockquote>But power, of some kind or other, will survive the shock in which manners and opinions perish, and it will find other and worse means for its support.</blockquote>  
    <figcaption>Edmund Burke, <cite>Reflections on the Revolution in France</cite></figcaption>  
</figure>  

<p>Burke<br />
We live here, slowly,<br />
on these ashes.  </p>

<p>What can grow here?  </p>

<p>One wonders<br />
how much Abu Ghraib remains,<br />
how much the screams have done their work<br />
and keep on working,  </p>

<p>But one never wonders,<br />
oh my soul,<br />
that life goes on.  </p>

<p>That is for another place and time,<br />
across some ocean,<br />
on some barren rock<br />
where men and what remains<br />
are left to speculation.  </p>

<p>You and I live here,<br />
and we must grow things from these ashes,<br />
if not only to have grown them,<br />
but because we otherwise<br />
must fear what grows unhindered.  </p>

<p>So kill the weeds,<br />
the poison leaves,<br />
the ash-plants, naked, dancing on the hill,  </p>

<p>and scatter seeds<br />
for fruit and flower,<br />
pleasing sights,<br />
yet good for food.  </p>

<p>Remember this place, though, child.<br />
and do not dwell here for too long.  </p>

<p>III.  </p>

<figure>  
    <blockquote>The usurpation...will hold power by arts similar to those by which it has acquired it.</blockquote>  
    <figcaption>Edmund Burke, <cite>Reflections on the Revolution in France</cite></figcaption>  
</figure>  

<p>Burke<br />
Terror is terrible,<br />
on this we agree,  </p>

<p>But why have we been terrible?  </p>

<p>Perhaps it is the proximity of conflict,<br />
the inevitable germination<br />
on both sides.  </p>

<p>Or was it usurpation?  </p>

<p>Or just another slough<br />
of body becoming body?  </p>

<p>We are not like the stars,<br />
we are too wet,  </p>

<p>And we must find within ourselves,<br />
that something, turning,  </p>

<p>that holds them apart.</p>
