                <h3>Maybe for the Last Time</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>24 October 2025</small></small></em></p>

<p>With a spark I remember another flame,<br />
one forbidden by time and place<br />
and another man. I cannot understand<br />
why these feelings, these urgings, these warm<br />
protestations against a cold fate, as her eros<br />
peeks through every word, and I dare<br />
to become so disturbed that I dream of her,<br />
me, in another time, place, which is never to be.<br />
Do dreams heal us or sicken what feels sick already?<br />
What hope is there really for arrival, for destination,<br />
for we storm-tossed, adjacent to the madness of the gods?<br />
It just cannot be reconciled, no, not this soul<br />
and that eros, not here and not anywhere,<br />
never and not near forever nor always, alone<br />
in a word, yet disturbed nonetheless by the playful flirtation<br />
which surely was meant without harm.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>But I grow from it into a better man.<br />
Maybe "healed" is too strong, but "improved" could be said<br />
and believed. Must we look to one older to teach<br />
what can only be learned in the trying, from making mistakes?<br />
Can we offer this gift to one younger?  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>We must pay it forward, the knowledge<br />
of how to behave and to love even those<br />
of the opposite sex. It has never been easy,<br />
and how many times has this lesson been learned incompletely,<br />
for how many loves are a farce, just a pale imitation<br />
without any meat on their bones?<br />
But we learn most by doing, and even a playful imagining<br />
serves as a kind of practice, a sacred arena<br />
of self-discovery, where souls can mingle without repercussions.<br />
But does she know that she offers this gift, or does she<br />
by instinct entice out of me that part of a man<br />
that would like to learn love from hate, to distinguish<br />
these modes of intensity, and perhaps combine them<br />
in something more grounded, a human endeavor<br />
to make one from two, which must always cause friction<br />
but also makes living worthwhile...?  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>In the end, I'm not sure what to make<br />
of this feeling, perhaps one-sided, perhaps even pathological,<br />
and so I am grateful but cautious. She may not know<br />
that what she awakens is capable of callous cruelty,<br />
and this by design, for a man must have war within him<br />
if he is to build a home and protect it, and always<br />
he brings that capacity indoors too. She must learn<br />
to respect it, as I also learn what it means to have peace<br />
at the end of a long day, when the sun passes over the edge<br />
of adventure, maybe for the last time.</p>
