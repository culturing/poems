                <h3>Where True Power Lies</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>12 October 2025</small></small></em></p>  

<p class='url' style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>https://poems.culturing.net/2025/10/where-true-power-lies/</small></small></em></p>  

<p>The father sits enthroned on a pile of books,<br />
self-assured and aware of nothing, smug<br />
with a smugness that begs to be heard,<br />
to be understood and obeyed. If he ever<br />
was in the womb, it's forgotten now,<br />
as his thousand clocks tick the night away<br />
until yesterday barely inspires a moment's reflection,<br />
and he is all, all is mind, and mind governs justly<br />
or else.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Were there not flowers, no sprouts<br />
poking through the cement of his chamber<br />
to enliven his hoary soul, to make supple<br />
the rigid laws, the plans of old, which have surely<br />
expired by now? And would he have noticed if there were?  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>He could never have noticed, alone in his thoughts,<br />
in a world of seclusion, cut off from vitality,<br />
hope, and pain. For of course it is true<br />
that a few of the flowers are poisoned, and therefore<br />
to banish them <em>seems</em> not misguided to one<br />
who is specially weak to poison. But are there not some<br />
who can taste and smell with strong stomachs,<br />
who experience even the poisonous flowers without despair?<br />
He was not one of these, not by far, and endemic disease<br />
is no way to bring children to life, so he settled<br />
for civilization instead.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>But the earth would not have it, refusing him rest,<br />
letting pain be the constant reminder that laws are not able<br />
to contain the wilderness. He was unhappy, and yet he<br />
was hurt most by things that could save him<br />
by opening (shattering) his chamber and sentencing him<br />
to life, lived only to the fullest. But he was afraid,<br />
so afraid that even death seemed better<br />
than the struggle required by life. So he stayed incomplete,<br />
as a form with no matter, a bundle of rules with no purpose.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>The light was a surprise, coming suddenly out of some faraway sky,<br />
to ignite the seedlings that had nestled in the earth<br />
for long enough. Now books grown over with vines<br />
form a part of the eternal cycle of birth and decay,<br />
and all laws are a part of the story, not over and above it.<br />
The father reclines with a newfound mirth, understanding at last<br />
that his role is to tend to the gardens of life, not control them,<br />
and never to stifle what grows, for one never knows<br />
whether an acorn is destined for oakness,<br />
and the forest could use more oakness, as well as<br />
a bit of gentle order, an order that never forgets<br />
where true power lies.</p>
