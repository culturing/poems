                <h3>What Waiting Means</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>27 August 2025</small></small></em></p>  

<p class='url' style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>https://poems.culturing.net/2025/08/what-waiting-means/</small></small></em></p>  

<p>It was a strange invitation, wrapped in metaphor,<br />
baked in a poet's heart. But the heat of that heart<br />
is untrustworthy, cannot be turned on by choice.<br />
So I capture its moments in words, hoping you<br />
dear reader may just for a moment remember me<br />
not as I was, but as I wanted to be.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>There is no kiln to light. The embers dwindle, and I<br />
am alone with my darkest parts. Who's to say whether<br />
life is mistaken in some fundamental way, whether we<br />
are tossed hopeless by waves of chaos and change<br />
regardless of choices made? Who'd want more?<br />
Who would pass on the cycle to new generations, just to watch<br />
as they also flounder? What hope can this cure?<br />
There is no fire either, just stories of fire, the memories<br />
of what worked before. There is only the loneliest path,<br />
the one I know better than life itself, the one that leads<br />
into oblivion.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>But then light comes, that staggering light,<br />
which illumines this darkest of nights. I'm alive.<br />
And how can this be? How can such things be?<br />
Every heartbeat an indecipherable miracle, each breath<br />
the spirit of God (come again to remind me<br />
how so unlike churches he is), and I wonder<br />
what place I might have in this universe<br />
pulsing with life, which is brimful of folly and pain<br />
but also unquenchable hope.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>My place is to write this down, to record<br />
what has been, so that others will know, so that some few will see<br />
what could be, and to you who believe, I say:<br />
<em>let us be free</em>. It is never too late to begin.<br />
You must look first within, where your fire is undoubtable.<br />
Then use that flame to light torches that guide the way.<br />
There will be some who fear that your candle<br />
is meant to destroy, who will snuff it if given the choice.<br />
You must burn all the hotter to melt their instruments,<br />
to singe any wind that dares to extinguish the flame.<br />
But of course, you already know this. In fact,<br />
you could do no other. Your eyes tell me so.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>But those eyes are not candid. They bear not<br />
the full imprimatur of truth. They are under construction.<br />
They lack what suffices: eternal fuel, the wax<br />
of forever and always, to bind that flame to its holder,<br />
to make sense of flame itself, and to carry the warmth<br />
that is so sorely needed. What then? Can we call to it,<br />
summon with words to forsaken spaces that essence<br />
that once, and again, and forever ignites its very self<br />
in a panoply of dazzling colors and lights? Would that do?<br />
Or must we wait for another?  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>We must wait for another, but which one<br />
we never can (cannot yet) say. That is what waiting means.<br />
Until then, be at peace, if you can.</p>
