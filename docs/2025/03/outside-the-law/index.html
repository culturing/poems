                <h3>Outside the Law</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>08 March 2025</small></small></em></p>  

<p>Who would have guessed<br />
that another dawn comes,<br />
even for us? Yet it comes<br />
as we wander from day to day<br />
like the children we are in the morning,<br />
when life is too bright and we shield our eyes<br />
lest they burn out, as has happened<br />
to those who were here before. In that dawn,<br />
I stand ready to embrace the new spirit,<br />
for the blind have at times made good poets,<br />
and I feel likewise aligned with the tides<br />
of those minds that can linger over all<br />
the minutia that others pass by, and thereby<br />
can derive at their leisure some new eyes<br />
for a new kind of pride for mankind.  </p>

<p>But you know none can do it alone, and it's true<br />
that belief is the glue that combines us, even those<br />
found untrue, but for me, as for you, the delay<br />
between my needs and the will of the group forces<br />
solitude, and I would just like to invite you to join me<br />
outside of the Law of Rome, where the spirit can grow<br />
to fill needs and then test the waters apart<br />
from any pre-ordained Plan. Yes, there's life there,<br />
and lots of it, but we who have broken our chains<br />
now stand dumbstruck, unsure how to build or produce order<br />
without simply rechaining others, as well as ourselves,<br />
with the shackles of Law run amok (even making<br />
chainbreaking its own kind of law!) I would like<br />
to remind you: think harder. Our children depend on it.</p>
