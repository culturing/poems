                <h3>An Ear to the Whole</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>06 November 2025</small></small></em></p>  

<p class='url' style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>https://poems.culturing.net/2025/11/an-ear-to-the-whole/</small></small></em></p>  

<p>How curious now, having flown so close to reality,<br />
that everyday life is what feels like a dream, and my dreams<br />
feel most real. In a sense I have been underground<br />
long enough, having decorated all of the ornamental chambers<br />
in the cave of my heart. There will be no visitors, and that<br />
is because of a choice that I can't quite regret<br />
though I can wish against its necessity. Fate holds firm,<br />
and my life continues as ever a desolation, lacking the love<br />
that makes life endurable, and lacking it most of all<br />
in my own heart.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>And yet I have made secret vows, and affirm them<br />
time after time. Can it be that this love could be <em>easy</em><br />
and dares to be tried, despite all protestations? What hope<br />
can be realized? What interest lingers despite these harsh blows<br />
that would kill a lesser desire? If a love is not battle-tested,<br />
who knows its worth? Are we learning (or proving)<br />
that something here warrants remembrance, that something endures<br />
what no prior love could endure? I would like to think so,<br />
but then there is the rub, because hope can be mother to illusion.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>And so I must straddle this ambiguity, letting both sides<br />
sing their songs, even when the cacophony drowns out all sense of order,<br />
because neither side will submit. I must gird myself like Odysseus<br />
against the temptation to listen to one side or the other, because both are essential,<br />
and only together will they tell the story<br />
of what has transpired here. Apart each song sings of dejection<br />
and woe, but together their harmony is grander than either alone,<br />
as sweet counterpoint answers dark sorrow with the only possible cure.<br />
To these melodies, then, let us turn, with an ear to the whole<br />
and a promise to hold them in tension, whatever may come.</p>
