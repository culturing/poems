                <h3>Drawing Blood</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>30 December 2025</small></small></em></p>  

<p class='url' style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>https://poems.culturing.net/2025/12/drawing-blood/</small></small></em></p>  

<p>Maybe she was right after all<br />
not to trust this fickle heart. But am I to blame?<br />
Doesn't love require <em>cooperation</em>, not a solitary<br />
tending of the flame? It's always the same,<br />
somehow my calls for structure go unheeded,<br />
though without it, without fail, my love grows cold.<br />
I shall grow old, it matters not which way,<br />
whether on my own or in the arms of another.<br />
It is no use. If she has seen me and withdrawn<br />
she knows what she's doing. She knows how to choose.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>And yet this time something lingers, even when<br />
the fever subsides, a kind of admiration, genuine respect.<br />
She is a <em>woman</em> in the deepest sense, aware of things<br />
no man can know, and she could make me stronger<br />
if she chooses. But I cannot now rely on possible strength,<br />
or else I'd find myself enfeebled when it's withdrawn,<br />
and it <em>can</em> be withdrawn, whenever her fancy chooses. Am I<br />
the fickle one now? Does she not have the power<br />
of retreat, and wield it forcefully, to get her way?<br />
How shall we disagree? As equals, each side speaking plainly?<br />
Or as lovers, tugging each other's strings, the strings<br />
that bind two hearts in the dark of passion, feeling<br />
no remorse? But can I <em>trust</em> her in this darkness,<br />
with these strings? No feeling answers this haunting question,<br />
at least not adequately, without hesitation and fear.<br />
Perhaps one only learns by trying, but of course, by then<br />
it's too late to sever the bond without drawing blood.  </p>

<p>Let the waters of time rise and fall<br />
to dilute these libations of blood.<br />
I must stand tall.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>This then reveals the true pain of the call.<br />
It was never the fear of a sudden failure, but rather<br />
the fear of a long and protracted dissolution, through which<br />
one bleeds out or nearly so. This fear I think<br />
never entirely fades, but the pull of desire, the hope<br />
of two made one and thereby whole, entices lovers<br />
and would-be lovers to forge a bond, or perhaps even<br />
forges it for them, against their wills. They just<br />
find themselves bound, heaven knows, although heaven itself<br />
cannot break these bonds. Only those who are bound<br />
can dissolve them, anchored so deep<br />
that none but the anchoring soul can release them,<br />
and even these souls often spasm and struggle<br />
to do what they will, clenching harder when they would let go.<br />
We do well not to know how we fare,<br />
for this knowledge makes love (and thus life)<br />
such a violent thing, more like nature<br />
than civilization would have us believe.</p>
