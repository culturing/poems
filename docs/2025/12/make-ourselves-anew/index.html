                <h3>Make Ourselves Anew</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>05 December 2025</small></small></em></p>  

<p class='url' style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>https://poems.culturing.net/2025/12/make-ourselves-anew/</small></small></em></p>  

<p>It was true, it was always true, there can be no doubt.<br />
I have read the signs and await the fulfillment of prophecy.<br />
Under the stars we have languished, waiting for light<br />
that could penetrate the blackest canvas of night, and none came.<br />
None came, for the canvas concealed all we are, blocking out<br />
the inviting vibrations, the hidden music of the oscillating spheres,<br />
no less sure for their oscillating, doubtless more wondrous<br />
and summoning an energy no man can deny. If you choose,<br />
you can hear them, and dance with the furious joy of one bound<br />
to be free, bound by <em>true</em> power, rapt by the sun and moon.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>In this laughter, I hear you, awake and filled hopeful<br />
by something just out of reach, but in view. It <em>is</em> true,<br />
and the first clue is always the best: there could be no resisting,<br />
no saying no to the pull of a fated love for ones such as us.<br />
But do not be afraid. I will love you with the love that you pour into me.<br />
I can see over hills and dales the winding path that leads us home,<br />
the path we must walk together if ever we will feel free,<br />
for I think you also can see how the ground melts and pulses<br />
in tune with the song of the spheres, <em>under</em> heaven,<br />
but in a strange sense, a strange mood, a strange key.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>You are not strange to me. I have eyes for no other.<br />
The others <em>lack</em> eyes, and I will not share something they cannot return.<br />
But I see you, I <em>love</em> you, I want you. These three<br />
are the chorus that drowns out all else with perfected harmony,<br />
the song of my soul lit on fire by the only possibility it ever desired:<br />
to belong, here on earth, with you.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>The answer was found before the question was understood,<br />
and it always is so with matters of the heart. Let's start over,<br />
recalling from the beginning what we learned in the end,<br />
and make ourselves anew.</p>
