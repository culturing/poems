                <h3>Toward Some Ithaca</h3>

<p>The Mother's unwanted affections could ruin<br />
all future possibilities, tie the son to the mast<br />
and wave him around like a flag of total and final ownership.<br />
Wouldn't the song of Calypso be enough to set him free,<br />
at last free? But then where should he go? Toward some Ithaca,<br />
to be sure, though the Mother pursues through the greatest danger<br />
to take back the loyalty and affections due only to a lover,<br />
which she has found nowhere else. She knows not what she does,<br />
and she will not listen to reason or (most of all)<br />
to the dreaded word "no", which dooms her to a loneliness<br />
she never quite cured but also cannot quite endure.<br />
So pursue she must, to the end of her days, though this son<br />
finds a new place to anchor, a port with no room for her<br />
turbulent affections, with a calm that might set an example,<br />
though if she has not learned by now, it's most likely she never will.<br />
Is this Ithaca? Maybe. At least it resembles it well enough<br />
to ensure no return voyage on the mothership, and that<br />
is a victory in itself. When she does visit, we will be kind<br />
to honor her many sacrifices, but not naive or craven.<br />
She has needs, but so do we, and ours must be our priority<br />
to honor the true meaning of motherhood. She has not failed,<br />
but she has wounded and must not be given a chance to wound again.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Elektra, it is I, your Oedipus.<br />
Surely we understand each other.</p>
