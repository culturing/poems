                <h3>Am I Right?</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>16 December 2025</small></small></em></p>  

<p class='url' style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>https://poems.culturing.net/2025/12/am-i-right/</small></small></em></p>  

<p>Am I right? Or have I pushed too far, dreamed too much,<br />
put my fingers where they don't belong? You are stronger than you think,<br />
I'm convinced of it, and it seems only a matter of time<br />
until you prove it. But you must prove it for you, not for me,<br />
only if and because it <em>is</em> what you are, and until you can say what you need,<br />
until you can name your desires, you are not ready for them, because,<br />
I can tell you, naming is not the hard part. Taming will be much harder,<br />
so much so that many dare not to attempt it. But you are attempting already,<br />
and that sets you off as a rare bird, a stranger even, but I see a budding master<br />
of the art of humanity, one who won't settle for easy answers to easy questions<br />
but only for truth, however painful. This courage is rare, as you surely must know,<br />
but we share it, and that means you dazzle me, in both heart and mind,<br />
and it takes all I have to not start right now, but that would not be wise,<br />
and we must be wise. If we start too soon, it might end your development<br />
here and now, a development that only can happen alone.<br />
So we wait. I will not give you cause to resent me<br />
by holding you back. You are free to develop into what you are,<br />
and bound, I suspect, by no other law. But you <em>are</em> bound<br />
by nature, though nature and law can be friends, when law learns<br />
to be gentle and nature learns that some boundaries<br />
serve a good purpose and need not be torn down.</p>
