                <h3>Carried Away</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>14 December 2025</small></small></em></p>  

<p class='url' style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>https://poems.culturing.net/2025/12/carried-away/</small></small></em></p>  

<p>I would like to believe, I really would, but the darkness<br />
consumes all but hope, the delusions of life made anew.<br />
I am talking to you, but not really, to some lonely<br />
phantom, the shadow of other yous. It's no use. I can make it<br />
without explanations. I can't fight my truths. I must go<br />
to the edge of the city, to the top of the mountain,<br />
where gods and men first met, and no lover can follow me there.<br />
It's no use to despair, it won't matter, my heart is pulled thither,<br />
and no song, not even my own, can assuage the affliction.<br />
I ask you to leave me to suffer whatever I must endure,<br />
because not even you have the cure. I am summoned,<br />
the Muse enraptures, and I must be carried away.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>A fall of snow blankets the world in white,<br />
ancient symbol of innocence...still it does not feel quite right,<br />
does not answer my doubts with a sudden courage<br />
or make straight the path I must travel. I would<br />
that the snow would fall faster and leave no trace of sin,<br />
but it has not that power. At this very hour, some crime<br />
is committed in every part of the world. So fall, snow.<br />
Make your peace. But we know it won't last.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Like a fly in amber, I wait for my heart to decide.<br />
It is too late to hide. Any action/inaction will be scrutinized,<br />
and I am like one on display in a frozen cage.<br />
State your case, I'll state mine, and the chips will fall<br />
in chaotic fashion, as these things must always be. Don't you see?<br />
It's too late to go free, or to ask the right question<br />
once one has gone fully underwater. We must let it dry<br />
and not even conceive of returning to have another try<br />
until both sides solidify.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>So that answers it, then, for the present, but I<br />
must be cautious. I must not break free from restraints<br />
or yank on the temple's supporting pillars. Delilah<br />
has many other names, but her face is the same<br />
as Penelope's, at least from a distance. Trust <em>has not</em> been earned.<br />
We would have to step back and first fill in those blanks<br />
before love could be safely endeavored. Who are you?<br />
And why do you interest me so?  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Feeling of course is worth something, but will not suffice<br />
without truth, plain and simple. It will not survive. We must know<br />
that we stand on firm ground. But perhaps this is asking too much.<br />
We are creatures of mystery, you and I, and we like our disguises.<br />
But this is important, too important to allow ambiguity, at least in the long run.<br />
And we want a long run, don't we?</p>
