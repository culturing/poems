                <h3>If Any Vigor Remains</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>05 December 2025</small></small></em></p>  

<p class='url' style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>https://poems.culturing.net/2025/12/if-any-vigor-remains/</small></small></em></p>  

<p>I came to them not with hope but with fury.<br />
They welcomed me, at least at first. Was it all<br />
a part of some sinister plan, a demonic machination,<br />
or were those demons in me all along? Is it fair<br />
to see demons in others, but not always true?<br />
My demons were stronger than life itself, and I sought<br />
to remove them by any means necessary. What<br />
were they thinking, to offer a refuge, a place<br />
where even demons are welcome? It was folly from the start,<br />
or something worse, a case of pathological arrogance.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>And yet somehow it worked, and I rose<br />
from the fires of hell into new life, forged<br />
by those fires and never forgetting their heat.<br />
I have scars to remind me, and memory works<br />
like a flame, disabusing old, dead beliefs,<br />
but not burning the live ones, so full of invigorating sap.<br />
Among the dead I see childish desires and teenage dreams,<br />
a longing to make the world safe, which can never come true.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Now my thoughts turn to you and whoever you are.<br />
I have come so far and I gather that you have too.<br />
There may still be some sap left inside us,<br />
some hope for another new life, worked out<br />
by these fires and the spasms of time, to remind us<br />
that where we have come from is where we are going,<br />
that all life returns to the center, the source,<br />
and that even this energy is not less than sacred.<br />
Tomorrow is what it will be, and today we find wholeness<br />
not in ourselves, but in what those selves could become.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>But what can they become? What can any once dead<br />
ever hope to become? There is light, if you see it,<br />
beyond the horizon, both under the skin and in between stars,<br />
which confirms who we are. It's another lost dream, one more<br />
reverie, this time tethered to objects worthy of praise.<br />
Underneath, all is changed, and the sky fills with wonder<br />
and love as new light rushes in. It's a love that stands firm,<br />
not forgetting the heat of the flame or the storm-tossed waves,<br />
but combining them, here, in this heart, which can answer<br />
the deepest longing and give shape to pain that otherwise overwhelms.<br />
It's this love that the lost can become if with courage<br />
they stand their ground in the crucible of life and death,<br />
if their hope is not conquered, and if any vigor remains.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>They let me be childish, that was their folly<br />
and their appeal, for I was not ready to stand<br />
and bear my own weight. But in time I grew stronger,<br />
and they, I'm afraid, did not. Once time came<br />
to reap the harvest sown years before<br />
there was nowhere to go but down, through the depths<br />
of unconscious longing, the archetypes of despair. I was there,<br />
I remember, and whether any other has grown more aware<br />
through my presence, or whether they still wander on<br />
through the night of impermanent dreams, I can say<br />
I am free, and let these things be, as a testament<br />
to what was destroyed and forever destroyed, but which rises<br />
again and again in every mother's loving arms. There is no<br />
final cure, for the answer is to ask the question again,<br />
in a reproduction, a false half-double of me,<br />
born out of the strength I have earned. But a child must be childish<br />
and so must outgrow the childhood cast upon it.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>I am not at the end, not quite, but somewhere<br />
in the middle, awake but still dreaming, alive<br />
but not sure that life really is good. Could it be<br />
that my meaning is out there, under the stars, where gods<br />
and heroes struggle to carry the light of day? Or is it<br />
in here, in my heart? I know where to start,<br />
and, I think, where things end. So long, friend.<br />
I have told you the way. If you take it is your decision.</p>
