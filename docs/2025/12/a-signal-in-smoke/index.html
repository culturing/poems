                <h3>A Signal in Smoke</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>26 December 2025</small></small></em></p>  

<p class='url' style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>https://poems.culturing.net/2025/12/a-signal-in-smoke/</small></small></em></p>  

<p>A new pain, new decisions, the war of the magi<br />
brought home to familiar places, the agonies and ecstasies<br />
of love and hate. Is there any new ground, any place<br />
where a dream can thrive, without constant embitterment?<br />
There is still the road, but the road is long, and not really a home.<br />
What of building a new home, in time, after healing?  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Of course one could never endeavor to be alone,<br />
it just happens that way sometimes, because in its disguises<br />
the sun hides its eyes, and one loses sight of the meaning,<br />
the center of life and the essence of time, whence all things derive<br />
and to which they return. All these walls we so carefully build<br />
are a clear delusion, protecting our minds from the brutal reality<br />
that all things fade into another, given enough time.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>So we have waged war against time in pursuit of stasis,<br />
eternal stasis, the worst of all possible worlds, because lacking<br />
the one thing that makes life exciting, its movement,<br />
and lacking also the dangers that call for virtue.<br />
Thus men are superfluous and become an endangered species.<br />
Many are born, but not many become fully grown,<br />
and why should they? Perhaps for the joy of it,<br />
as some men tend gardens despite having plenty to eat.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>But the garden now feels under siege, and the few<br />
who have good ones must fight tooth and nail to defend them<br />
against the hordes of roving barbarians, homeless and looking<br />
for empires to topple. But there is one hope, that the hordes<br />
may be charmed, for a moment at least, by words and songs<br />
sung skillfully or played upon a lyre.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>But this hope is a foolish one, foolish because<br />
most barbarians cling to barbarity as a totem<br />
and will not let go. So we build higher walls,<br />
more defenses, and send up a signal in smoke<br />
hoping somewhere out there, another is doing the same.</p>
