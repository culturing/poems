<p>Something feels off, and I cannot quite name it.<br />
One hopes for a final resolution, but one never comes.<br />
Must we drift in uncertainty forever? I do not blame you,<br />
but I must be true to my doubts, because otherwise<br />
we may both find ourselves lost, and not in ecstasy...<br />
I don't know you that well, not as well as I'd like,<br />
and a love that begins before knowledge cannot long endure,<br />
not for me, because what am I loving? A phantom, a figment,<br />
a dream? There's a way to firmer ground, but I fear<br />
we have missed it, and gone around to the love chamber<br />
far too soon. And it can't be undone. Can we go back<br />
and find each other as we really are? It is not<br />
that far, but it carries a risk: we may not like what we find.<br />
Still this outcome is better than a false love, which would be<br />
a prison for both of us. I do want you, and I do want love<br />
to come true, but some labor remains to ensure that we are not just lost<br />
in that ether of blue, but have four feet firmly planted on earth.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>But are dreams not their own door to reality?<br />
If so, then the answer is clear: we are meant to be.<br />
There are too many signs to ignore or write off as coincidence.<br />
Something is happening, something real,<br />
though the mind must play catchup and flail to understand...<br />
can it be that understanding is not needed here,<br />
that the pull of some unseen gravity works its power<br />
in a way much stronger than any mind? If so,<br />
it is not my power, or yours, that binds us, but something<br />
higher, much higher, and deeper than words can explain.<br />
If we know this feeling, the pull of its power,<br />
then I think we should trust it, because in the final analysis<br />
this <em>is</em> the earth into which we are planted, and which grows in us,<br />
as in all men and women, when the time is right.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>And the time <em>is</em> right, that is hard to ignore or deny,<br />
but I look one last time to a desolate sky<br />
as if it knew the answer, as if it brings any gift<br />
but rain, to nourish the seeds. Now you and I are caught<br />
in the dance of the cycle of regeneration, with Demeter's blessing,<br />
and time will tell if it makes us happy, but Lord knows<br />
we must play our parts.</p>
