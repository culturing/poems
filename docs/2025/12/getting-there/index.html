                <h3>Getting There</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>16 December 2025</small></small></em></p>  

<p class='url' style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>https://poems.culturing.net/2025/12/getting-there/</small></small></em></p>  

<p>If I should call now, it would interrupt a process<br />
set in motion ages, many lifetimes ago, and that process<br />
is what matters most right now. I believe in you,<br />
but I must not step in any more than I have. You will master<br />
the steps of this new dance, your own steps, not mine or anyone else's,<br />
and only then feel free. But I see a bright future for you,<br />
where you soar in your truth and live unafraid,<br />
needing no other face to express how you feel, knowing your face<br />
is beautiful, and that you can wear it proudly, even when few understand.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>But there is an art of concealment, which hides the truth<br />
as an act of love, from those not equipped to handle it.<br />
I think you will know what I mean, most attentive reader,<br />
because I have practiced this art, and I gather<br />
that you have too. But this art remains valid and needed<br />
to keep small souls from bursting with too much truth.<br />
"Mankind cannot bear very much reality" Eliot says,<br />
with good reason and perhaps a little bit too much truth.<br />
But the point is to carve out a private sphere,<br />
a "room of one's own", a <em>home</em>, where truth can be carried<br />
with dignity and courage, to the best of one's ability.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Abilities vary wildly, though, and nobody knows<br />
how or why some can know and some can't. For we knowers,<br />
few pains are as great as those caused by an unjust authority,<br />
forcing its ignorance upon us from the top down. It cannot<br />
be endured, but it must be, at least for a time, until<br />
one has made way for a new life one always was living<br />
in secret. There is an old name for this, μεγαλόψυχος.<br />
"Nobility" also suffices, but what's in a name?<br />
It's the <em>thing</em> that endures in perennial cycle, and we<br />
are the latest crop, ripe for harvest. It is not a crime<br />
to be different, in fact it may be a great gift, the true source<br />
of the patterns lived out by the ones who fit in. Every culture<br />
begins as a dream, and we dreamers can hold our heads high<br />
as members of a higher order, the provenance of dreams.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>So dream well, my sweet, and do not despair.<br />
You seem to be getting there.</p>
