                <h3>Whatever This Call Entails</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>26 September 2025</small></small></em></p>  

<p class='url' style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>https://poems.culturing.net/2025/09/whatever-this-call-entails/</small></small></em></p>  

<p>No one knows, do they, where roads lead<br />
or how to stay true to the path<br />
one intended to take...in the forest<br />
of life only instinct can serve as a guide.<br />
But which instinct prevails? Surely some<br />
will destroy just as surely some<br />
lead to new life. Can we build<br />
<em>around</em> instinct the structures that guide her<br />
to safety and fulfillment? Is that<br />
the true task? One that's doomed from the start<br />
yet imperative nonetheless...<br />
Or is wandering still an option?  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Wandering is not an option<br />
for those who have glimpsed what it means<br />
to be happy. For these, to not try<br />
would be treason, a failure to heed<br />
the calling horn. There are vessels to fill,<br />
there are songs to write, and the world<br />
spins forward forever, confounding our day in the sun.<br />
The horn calls at the appointed time<br />
to draw a man out of himself and into eternity.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Is there any other experience that compares<br />
to giving life? Why then do we waste such precious time<br />
on trivialities? There's not much point in arguing.<br />
Those who know can't forget, and those who don't won't learn<br />
through words, but only if the horn rips through their souls,<br />
and we cannot summon the horn. It calls in its own time<br />
to summon <em>us</em> back to the great chain of being, or at least<br />
to the core of life's mystery. Who can resist?<br />
So adieu to the solitary musings, farewell to the cage of the heart<br />
and a warm-hearted welcome to whatever this call entails.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>But is it really time? Mischievous time,<br />
which hints where it does not fulfill? If only time<br />
would stop a moment, let me get my bearings<br />
and appoint myself director of my life.<br />
Then I'd find peace. But it is not to be,<br />
not here where all things change, where man<br />
exposed to the elements discovers himself<br />
with horror. And yet I dwell here, and must<br />
dwell here, if I am to dwell at all,<br />
because this call rekindles the horror<br />
though it also sings of hope.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Hope, that thing with feathers, lofty,<br />
erudite, and vain, what can you say<br />
when faced with darkness, lust, and pain?<br />
It is unclear which way the world turns,<br />
how it moves or how our many special loves<br />
turn back to dust. But I know this much:<br />
it cannot be helped, from either end,<br />
the falling or the getting up. In each case<br />
Time and its eunuch on the horn<br />
blow forceful melodies to doom mankind<br />
to trying what so rarely comes to pass.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow,<br />
I've heard that time keeps passing,<br />
that our lives are mere ephemera,<br />
but in the womb one hopes for something more.</p>
