                <h3>A Home of My Own Design</h3>

<p>The mother reaches for love, remembering<br />
her children and how they brought her<br />
the orgasm of birth. Was their life<br />
a consumable good, brought forth just to nourish<br />
and satisfy the mother's most secret desire?<br />
Had they not their own life, their own pulse,<br />
their own dreams? She is sacred, of course,<br />
as the giver of life, and yet darkened<br />
by unfelt desire and urgent craving<br />
for a kind of connection that cannot be understood,<br />
which her own life denies her. Has some man<br />
failed her that she looks to her children<br />
for the kind of fulfillment through love<br />
that can only be known by equals? It was never<br />
voluntary, not in her whole life, and so<br />
why should her love be any different?  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>It should differ because the heart breaks<br />
absent freedom, and a mother who does not care<br />
that her child's heart breaks is no mother at all.<br />
But what if she can't help it? What if<br />
she is doing her best, though constrained<br />
by her own limitations? The child must survive,<br />
and on this they agree, though the needs of the child<br />
are ignored, not from malice, but from simple ignorance, or a conflict of needs,<br />
a conflict of personalities perhaps, but more likely<br />
a defect of one of them.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>And yet the sun still rises, birds still sing<br />
and rivers flow as they have always flown.<br />
Does time heal or does time make us numb,<br />
having tired of the pain and of all attempts to heal?<br />
Sometimes flight is the prudent choice, when healing<br />
is urgently needed, and no other path offers<br />
even the prospect of life. But the best strength<br />
stands firm in the galeforce winds,<br />
in the hurricane of maddening, unwanted love<br />
and says "no" for as long as it takes.<br />
And yet even this strength, though it wins many battles,<br />
may never at last win the war, which began<br />
before any now living were born. But the fight<br />
is worth fighting, and one day this soldier,<br />
when the dust has settled, may find himself<br />
longing for even this puzzling enemy, whose love was too much,<br />
to explain where he came from, and why<br />
he is good at building walls, thick walls<br />
that so few ever enter, within which at least he is free.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>But a door might suffice, if, supposing we found<br />
a good locksmith, we keep out intruders. This way<br />
the walls stand as a testament<br />
to all that has come before, the reality of human folly<br />
and the pain of ignorance. This is the way<br />
to life, an honest life, though one not lacking in pain.<br />
So good morning sweet sun. I now greet you<br />
from safety, aware and vigilant but calm and at rest<br />
in a home at last, and a home of my own design.</p>
