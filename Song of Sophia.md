### Song of Sophia

#### I. Akrasia

    When there were no depths, I was brought forth,
        When there were no springs abounding with water.

Time slipped, fell\
through black holes\
to where I dwelt,

Stillborn in a rotting womb,\
with histories untold.

I cut my own cord.

Day by day I played \
between Olympian plains\
and Horeb,

Learning nothing,

For the ground had been well-tread \
by tanks and wise men\
teaching shadows

*HEY\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS JUST IN \
HEY\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ERECTILE  \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DYSFUNCTION\
HEY \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LOOK \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KITTENS\
HEY\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BIKINIS  \
HEY\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HAVE YOU SEEN \
HEY\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;YOU THERE ??\
HEY\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I LOVE YOU. \
HEY\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LOVE ME <3\
HEY*

#### II. Nostoi

    Does not wisdom cry out,
        And understanding lift up her voice?

Thunder roars,\
and as a man who pants for water\
sees the rock break,

And sees the streams long dried by drought\
begin to flow, \
and drinks,

So too I flee the wasteland.

#### III. Paideia

    To you, O men, I call,
        and my voice is to the sons of men.

I gaze upon a field grown ripe with wheat\
and feel the warmth of rosy-fingered Dawn\
who has not failed to rise. I grip the scythe,

And take upon myself beginnings\
and their ends, and find this meaning\
*sicut erat in principio.*
