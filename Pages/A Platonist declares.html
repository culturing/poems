<p>A Platonist declares that all is Soul,<br />
but now we doubt it. Rather, we believe<br />
in clocks that wind themselves, and Nature too.<br />
But what makes Nature go? We'd love to know,<br />
but still we don't. Though answers sometimes<br />
run their course, some questions last forever.<br />
But has no one noticed Plato's chosen mode?<br />
In discourse questions outrank answers<br />
two to one. So when a Platonist declares<br />
on any subject, greet him with a question,<br />
see how well he knows his master's teaching.<br />
Yet let's not discard a theory for a worse one.<br />
Ask, who makes the clock? Not I. And then ask: Why?  </p>
