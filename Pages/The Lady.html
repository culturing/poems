</p>

<p>I dreamed I saw a Lady<br />
perched atop a milk-white stair,<br />
overlooking starry oceans<br />
and defining what was there.</p>

<p>Beneath her golden tresses<br />
opened up a gnawing void,<br />
which catapulted us to freedom.<br />
Soon all motion was destroyed!</p>

<p>The Lady did not stir, but crooned,<br />
and smiled a softer smile<br />
than wisest men have dared to dream.<br />
Then she turned her back awhile.</p>

<p>The void kept belching fire,<br />
and the only thing we knew<br />
was its bedevilment and whirl.<br />
It proved that all things are see-through!</p>

<p>The Lady meanwhile, laughing,<br />
stayed atop of how things are,<br />
and by the time we knew what hit us,<br />
saw we hadn’t gotten far.</p>

<p>The morning came as always,<br />
and we, naked on her shore,<br />
cried out, “Dear Lady, let us near!<br />
Your sweet forgiveness, we implore!”</p>

<p>She looked at all our nakedness,<br />
saw through our praise and plight,<br />
and said, “Fools, get yourselves together,<br />
or else get out of my sight!”</p>
