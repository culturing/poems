                <h3>Old Flames</h3>

<p style='margin:0; margin-top: -1.25rem'><em><small><small>12 September 2022</small></small></em></p>  

<p>As I sit, I remember the point of the story,<br />
the struggle to keep out the cold.<br />
It was always getting colder, no matter the weather,<br />
and we, like frontiersmen, built houses and fires<br />
to keep ourselves warm. But the houses grow old,<br />
fires dim, and the embers are hardly remembered.<br />
I say, as I sit, I remember those embers,<br />
how long-dwindled fires once burned in our hearts,<br />
or if not in ours, then in our grandfathers' hearts.<br />
But we are the ones who are here (they are not, or may be<br />
but are not as they were), yet their embers remain<br />
unremembered. I think that is sad, but not new.<br />
As I sit, I remember a time, and another,<br />
when history was not remembered. I will not give names,<br />
but you likely know that this is true.<br />
There's a cold wind breathing at the door.<br />
It's for us, and against us. I think we do well<br />
to remember it. Even the best insulation<br />
will never make heat. We will need a new flame.<br />
We must ask where the old flames have gone.</p>
