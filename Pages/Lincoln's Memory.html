<p>So favored forms of power<br />
shall not perish from the earth,<br />
would you please sing for us, O History,<br />
about the urgent birth<br />
of these great, terrible, united States,<br />
which, though conceived in Liberty,<br />
did break, some say, that vow?</p>

<p>This nation under God, twice founded,<br />
ever failing, yet immortal,<br />
did embark toward the dream of Freedom<br />
led by that one stout Kentuckian<br />
who hated much as loved<br />
and took a promise unfulfilled<br />
and made it law to bind on all.</p>

<p>This promise, called Equality,<br />
our hope in days to come,<br />
arose, O History! through violence,<br />
and herein lies its song.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Twas eighteen-fifty-eight, whereon a Senate seat contended<br />
led the folks of Illinois to dream they saw a President.<br />
One Lincoln-not-yet-Deity, preparing for debate,<br />
stood by a portrait of old Jefferson, to whom he could relate,<br />
and said,</p>

<p>“Old predecessor tongue with wings, remind me,<br />
whence came our brave truth,<br />
that all men are created equal.<br />
Knew you this in youth?”</p>

<p>To which the painting said,<br />
“It was a growth of many years,<br />
first born on England’s hills<br />
in faithful regicide.”</p>

<p>And Lincoln asked,<br />
“But had you heard of man’s first disobedience<br />
and the fruit?“</p>

<p>Came quick reply:<br />
“Our Massachusetts friends knew of such things,<br />
but I did hope to purge all superstition,<br />
and robe God in Nature.”</p>

<p>“Ah, in nature,” Lincoln said.</p>

<p>”That’s right. For all can become noble<br />
if they’re only left alone.”</p>

<p>Great Lincoln, growing pond’rous,<br />
stroked his chin<br />
and paced before the painting,<br />
murmuring, “If left alone…”</p>

<p>He did not dare to broach the question,<br />
burned on his and other minds,<br />
of Slavery, but rather urged this thought:<br />
“Suppose we find all men not equal. Who’s at fault?”</p>

<p>But there was no reply.</p>

<p>The painting would not speak,<br />
and Lincoln found his affirmation.</p>

<p>As the sureness grew,<br />
he pondered long<br />
and nursed a budding song.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>This Lincoln after many years<br />
appeared before the dead<br />
and spoke the words<br />
we will not long remember,</p>

<p>for we must not hallow,<br />
must not consecrate that ground<br />
where many died and killed.</p>

<p>Thus Lincoln willed,<br />
and thus we must obey.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>But Oh, how Declaration<br />
had sent shocks across the sea<br />
as Mr. Jefferson endeavored<br />
to give ground to that new plea<br />
which was come forth just then,<br />
at last!</p>

<p>And when ‘twas time for tea in Boston,<br />
there was Paine in every head,<br />
and ‘twas ideas, sir, ideas!<br />
which would leave so many dead.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Lord, such war and terror<br />
bled from North down through the South<br />
until the only ones remaining<br />
banished God and punished doubt.</p>

<p>To devastation wrought,<br />
and to the horror not quite heeded,</p>

<p>To man’s ultimate obedience,<br />
friend History, give song.</p>
