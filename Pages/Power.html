<p>Power brings its many blessings,<br />
Though it comes by other names.<br />
This is what we find by singing.  </p>

<p>Days were young and love did sting us.<br />
All young people feel the same.<br />
They mix themselves with power’s blessings.  </p>

<p>Some find laurels, others cling<br />
To lovely childhood games.<br />
Thus they lose themselves in singing,  </p>

<p>Thus they fall before the morning,<br />
Thus they are to blame.<br />
But power brings at most mixed blessings,  </p>

<p>Power puts off dark and dying,<br />
Power’s light must wane.<br />
Therefore find thyself in singing,  </p>

<p>Make thine own some other name,<br />
And know I feel the same,<br />
Because this power mixes life with blessings.<br />
This is what we find by singing.  </p>
