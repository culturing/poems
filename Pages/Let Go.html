<p>Wandering, questioning,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;as before Dawn,<br />
I am <em>sure</em> of this much:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;that we hold our beliefs<br />
far too tightly.  </p>

<p>--</p>

<p>I think back,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I think back,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think back,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;but hear only more riveting.  </p>

<p>Rosie, poor Rosie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;no place for a woman here.  </p>

<p>--</p>

<p>What is the <em>other</em> beginning,<br />
the one without steel-plated Mind,<br />
where things grow as we all know they do?  </p>

<p>In the mountains,<br />
I hear baby truths being born.  </p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Begin <em>here</em>. Nowhere else.<br />
This is where you were born and will die.  </p>

<p>--</p>

<p>A rowdy patron observes: "You had to be there!"<br />
I think this is rather apt, and tell him so,<br />
but what more could I tell him?<br />
He knows what it is to know.  </p>
