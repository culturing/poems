</p>

<p>Consumed by the fool's errand of making life painless,<br />
we could never be bothered to think<br />
along lines that were not predetermined,<br />
defined by the will of the faceless consumers<br />
like us, who ran everything. Speechless,<br />
we floundered through chaos and form,<br />
but from time to time one had to wonder<br />
what all of it meant or succumb<br />
to the roar of consumption<br />
enduring through slogans and signs<br />
and most firmly in minds made of mud<br />
baked like stone. I was never a part of this,<br />
never aligned with the spineless<br />
who bear no weight, who crack under any demand,<br />
since demanding betrays their life's purpose.  </p>

<p>Again, these are errands for fools, but of course<br />
fools speak louder than thinkers and rule all<br />
but auspicious places, those private lands<br />
governed by men who will tolerate no more,<br />
who instead chose to stretch themselves out before knowing<br />
and learn what the gods have in store.  </p>

<p>The beatings continue, morale doesn't care,<br />
and one wonders how punishment ever was thought<br />
to cure suffering, or how anyone stands it.<br />
But stand it they do, if they must.<br />
Deeper silence where agony once named a people<br />
that banishes any adversity.<br />
How now, take heart and oppose this new ocean of troubles,<br />
or else turn to brooding for future's sake?  </p>

<p>I sing from the belly of the whale,<br />
which pursues its perfection for all,<br />
which leaves open no quarter for others,<br />
which swallows each culture in all,<br />
which cares nothing for time past or future,<br />
whose whiteness is barely a memory,<br />
whose grayness is given by all.  </p>

<p>With the hour now hidden but late,<br />
I cry out from the sea-foam that others may hear me.</p>
