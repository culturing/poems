</p>

<p>At midnight in the basement<br />
of a museum, some forgotten grotto<br />
deep in Mediterranean soil,  </p>

<p>I walked slow and silent,<br />
deep in thought,  </p>

<p>When lo! the image of a woman,<br />
be it Aphrodite, Juno,<br />
or some other, rose before me.  </p>

<p>I came to her side<br />
and noticed lying at her feet<br />
a fallen breast of stone,<br />
hers surely, lying prone,<br />
as though some vandal<br />
strove to make her pure.  </p>

<p>I put it back where it belongs<br />
and held it there,<br />
until her firmness made me sure,  </p>

<p>But sure of what,<br />
I do not know.  </p>

<p>I thought I could discern<br />
the faintest sigh,<br />
but she alone would know<br />
who fills the mind with wonder,  </p>

<p>so I wondered<br />
if the earth could be her home,<br />
or if she comes from some far-whispered plane<br />
that only poets know.  </p>
