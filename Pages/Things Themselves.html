</p>

<p>Until I met a woman,<br />
and her presence strengthened me,<br />
I did not know that God lives<br />
not in books, as Calvin claims,<br />
but inside things themselves.  </p>

<p>What mystery lies here<br />
remains to nourish those who care<br />
to take the secret that is there<br />
into a home, and let it steer<br />
the very lives of things themselves.  </p>

<p>But can we dwell among<br />
the secret song, the hidden call<br />
of Earth's long fall for the abyss?<br />
We have our churches.<br />
Are they tombs for things themselves?  </p>

<p>I think we have to think this through,<br />
for God has been a long time dying,<br />
though he rises from the dead,<br />
and he is not the only one.<br />
We know this too of things themselves.  </p>
