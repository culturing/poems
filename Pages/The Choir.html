</p>

<p>By silent seas we sit and sing<br />
Of life's unwrought enamelling<br />
As each day gathers into storm<br />
And reasons with our untold ire.</p>

<p>Rise fair song and banish woe<br />
For we must fear the foreman’s blow<br />
For though our fathers built with stone<br />
We build the world again each morn,</p>

<p>And tremble in the shade of steel,<br />
And ache for poison salesmen sell,<br />
And whirl in this ungrateful gyre<br />
To placate pioneering fire.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>What is this? What is my own?<br />
What good is a peopled home<br />
When urge and urge and urge inspire<br />
Epitomes forlorn?</p>

<p>Hope, where are your lovely feathers?<br />
All your crumbs are swept -- this weathered<br />
Leaf deceives -- these grasses wither.<br />
There are only bog and mire.</p>

<p>Who would dare to ope<br />
Pandora's vessel once again? What's left?<br />
All can see that Zeus has scorned<br />
Those Foresight has adorned.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>But summon those old voices hither.<br />
Sing a song against the dither.<br />
Won’t a mythic world reborn<br />
Reclassify revealed desire?</p>

<p>Make again that age-old beat.<br />
Forget the words that spell defeat.<br />
Abandon prod and thrust.<br />
Embrace the courage of the calling horn.</p>

<p>For we have feared the shades of steel,<br />
But harbor dreams of living well,<br />
And dream of lifting off the pyre,<br />
And lift this chorus as a choir.</p>
