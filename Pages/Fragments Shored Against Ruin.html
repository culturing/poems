<h4>1</h4>

<p>You are the last fighting chance<br />
for yourself,</p>

<p>A chamber, a kingdom<br />
-- <em>Cordelia!</em></p>

<p><em>Where is the throne?</em><br />
<em>What is flesh?</em></p>

<p>A clock in the hall<br />
A clock and no walls</p>

<p>And spinning<br />
Rome is burning</p>

<p><em>Tick Tick Tick</em> --</p>

<p>There are things that move the will<br />
that even the atom cannot kill --</p>

<p><em>There are things there are things</em></p>

<p>-- If you do not control yourself,<br />
who will?</p>

<h4>2</h4>

<p>The executive has surrendered<br />
all -- anarchy ensues.</p>

<p>The state in which one cannot say no,<br />
when one cannot stop,<br />
is called chaos today is chaos<br />
and we are revolving in kaleidoscope<br />
houses that looked fun</p>

<p>who am the last fighting chance<br />
for myself, the only opportunity<br />
to be free of that doggerel wretch<br />
who sits on the mind-throne</p>

<p>while, usurped, the executive wastes<br />
in heaps of sentiment and flesh<br />
that wash over all<br />
and bathe with the lime of body.</p>

<p>soma. soma soma soma<br />
take and live.</p>

<h4>3</h4>

<p>My body waffling through space<br />
and undigested time conceives<br />
Idea -- floats, as it were, above itself<br />
into ethereal otherlands</p>

<p>and waits.</p>

<p>Up, from where is only down,<br />
I fly, and divide this self<br />
into slivers, abandoning each<br />
at the foot of age-old Mind</p>

<p>Who takes them, warping tomorrow<br />
with hands of iron, cold. </p>

<p>I am left unanswered.</p>

<h4>4</h4>

<p>I fear the smallness of my mind<br />
surrounded by mysteries,</p>

<p>The abstract cave,<br />
philosopher's chains<br />
unbroken,</p>

<p>Bound,<br />
and sinking down.</p>

<p>And are there here no sunbeams,<br />
no exalted forms that dance<br />
on more than cavewall?</p>

<h4>5</h4>

<p>There are no tunes or strings to play<br />
unbloodied by the rage, unbridled<br />
by fearful faces, names<br />
turned dusty with shame.</p>

<p>How far the sky has fallen,<br />
how far! deep within our bowels</p>

<p>We cannot digest<br />
or swallow.</p>

<p>There is only us -- only the rage<br />
and the cold, swollen cage.<br />
The bruised age.</p>

<h4>6</h4>

<p>Listen. We will begin<br />
to repeal soporifics<br />
only in the light of more pure<br />
harmonies and form.</p>

<p>There can be no freedom in extravagance.</p>

<p>Love is the beginning but not the fruition,<br />
which comes only through discipline<br />
and a kind of violence.</p>

<p>Once we have established ourselves<br />
at the end of ourselves, and only then,<br />
can we draw from the ashes<br />
some kind of beginning.</p>

<h4>7</h4>

<p>Is there still a Song,<br />
and can I sing along?</p>

<p>This man, boy, heart beating hard and strong,<br />
'tis mine? And may I be wrong?</p>

<p>I have wallowed verily, wallowed long<br />
in the avenues and twisting ways<br />
of ecstasy and sorrow,</p>

<p>But there is forthcoming joy,<br />
awakened noise which learns to balance<br />
and to hope with poise</p>

<p>The truth of which<br />
<em>is There is There is There.</em></p>
