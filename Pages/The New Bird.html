</p>

<p>The idea waits upon a bough.<br />
The bird is in the parlor though.<br />
Tomorrow never comes for us,<br />
and so he sings for now.</p>

<p>But over in the city though<br />
the trees all stand erect,<br />
where there is no sought communion<br />
and the love is all in trust.</p>

<p>I do not speak for them,<br />
and only know the words I know.<br />
But for who would still hear,<br />
I have endeavored to show how.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Idea waits upon a bough.<br />
The bird is in the parlor though.<br />
Tomorrow has not come,<br />
and so he sings for now.</p>

<p>But over in the city now,<br />
the steel trees stand erect,<br />
and there is no more communion<br />
where all love is held in trust.</p>

<p>The song is not for those<br />
who sing of things one cannot know.<br />
The new bird sings, alas!<br />
for those who have no other sound.</p>
