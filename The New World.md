### The New World

Raised among wolves,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we've learned both bite and howl,\
but there is a new kind of life coming now.

An old life more truly,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one ought to be sure.\
Allow me to answer, I've no sinecure.

Upon an old hill\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there stood men young and old.\
They bore a fierce wind and were bold.

As one with one purpose\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they built there together\
foundations to last all weather.

That edifice fell,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the ruins remain.\
Do any dare build there again?
