### Crickets

Up upon a hill I heard\
the crickets chirping words:\
O boy, come here, come near,\
and stay and talk awhile.

My answer was to smile,\
and I did no more favors then,\
but crossed the valley of denial\
and arrived within their ken.

O boy, I heard more echoing,\
and sat, and stayed, and then\
felt all around a queer commotion\
stir the leaves, and break, and end.

And oh, ‘twas cool November,\
and the birds did softly sing,\
and if there’s one thing I’ll remember,\
it’s my softly taking wing

Upon the backs of those cold crickets,\
on the hill, who chirped with words,\
for as they chirped about salvation,\
they made sure that I had heard.
