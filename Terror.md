### Terror

Planes, flames, wreckage.

Images played, replayed\
in certain ways.

Oh, the horror.

News inspires\
terror terror acts of terror\
terrorist muslim extremist \
terror

all day long,\
even though there are children.

—

Loyalty is not at all times virtuous,\
but neither is disloyalty.

Either keeps things moving.

For those who have known terror,\
what of love?

Can such things be?

—

I hear the Bush \
in the wilderness,\
burning,

Take off my shoes\
and wait.

It cannot speak.

And this will not be easy.\
We must live with ourselves.

—

But one may ask,\
what *is* treason?

And more than one may answer.

And we have been like this, \
and with good reason,\
but we will not dwell on that now.

—

I fear the Bush has burnt,\
and we are alone,

But then a cry comes from the desert,

“Keep those embers burning!\
Night is coming!\
It is growing colder!”

And I wonder without wonder\
when the world would rather freeze.
