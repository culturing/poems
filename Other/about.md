## About

This site is a life's work in progress.

You will find two kinds of poem here. Longer, more sustained pieces akin to those that would be traditionally published, and shorter, more aphoristic pieces that often contain only partial thoughts. In my mind, these works are connected, comprising an organic whole, and the smaller works are the tissue that holds the whole together. The unifying theme is that they have grown from the same life. In many cases, ideas first appear in a smaller work, only to be fleshed out or refuted later in a larger one, sometimes with surprising results. Thus the temporal sequence is significant.

Nothing said here is meant to represent the last word (can any saying ever represent the last word?), not even the last word on the author's opinion. Each saying is an earnest representation of the author's thoughts at one moment, and that is the major criterion for inclusion in this collection. The minor criterion is that a poem must improve its readers.

I am both author and webmaster of this site â€” a rare privilege for a poet. This means that I control how these works appear. Please share them freely wherever you get your poetry, but with proper attribution (a link to <a href="https://poems.culturing.net">poems.culturing.net</a> will do).

If any of these poems have moved you, I would love to hear from you at <a href="mailto:author@culturing.net">author@culturing.net</a>.
