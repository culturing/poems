<p>Ah, poetry, the silly enterprise of leisured men with nothing better to do. Why read it? Why have anything to do with it?</p>

<p>Robert Frost called poetry a "momentary stay against confusion." I wish to amend this and say that poetry is a <em>study</em> of confusion. Life is confusing by nature. A scientist or politician who presents his propositions with exactness is often deceived, if not a deceiver.</p>

<p>The study of poetry teaches us how to disambiguate. Typical prose presents only one possible disambiguation. This can become tyrannical. The prose writer has digested his material and presents it to the reader like a mother bird with a worm. It is like the old saying about giving a man a fish versus teaching him to fish. Eventually both will need to find their own food.</p>

<p>Life is full of meals that are hard to find and other confusions. For example, when a parent dies or one's country commits a heinous crime. Resolving these difficulties requires serious discipline. Since ancient times, poetry has been understood as a vital part of education. So it can still be. It matters little which poetry is studied, so long as it is good poetry. But what makes good poetry? If poetry is to be a study of confusion, it must present ambiguity, perhaps hinting at a path by which the ambiguity may be resolved, but the poem must not resolve it. The resolution occurs, if at all, within the reader. The point is to provide the reader with that experience. </p>

<p>Surely there are more fish than I can catch for myself, and I am quite happy to visit the market from time to time to sample them. But I will never love these as much as the ones that I do catch for myself, and I may need some that have never been caught before. It is for these times that the skills taught by poetry become vital. Experience is the best teacher, but poetry is a close second. It is one way to pass on what has been learned through experience. Confusions will come, and we do well to be ready.</p>
