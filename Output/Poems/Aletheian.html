                <h3>Aletheian</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>31 August 2022</small></small></em></p>  

<p>Some do not wish to join the project of empire,<br />
even after all these years. I shall call them<br />
Aletheian, to distinguish them from Roman soldiers<br />
eager for command. They rather seek what's hidden<br />
in the inner world of things, a world forgotten<br />
in the mad rush for imperium. But be things as they may,<br />
these few are hidden, too, unnoticed in the roaring crowd,<br />
the crowd as blind as ever, and no less so for their service.<br />
Oh, the Aletheians have endeavors too, like maybe breaking through<br />
the cycle of hereditary bullying, which, for Caesar,<br />
would make servants of us all. But serving whom?<br />
But more than this, these simply watch for signs,<br />
believing that a god, or something, speaks<br />
and can be heard. I like this last pursuit<br />
a little, and much more than I like empire.<br />
I think I am just half an Aletheian, and part Roman,<br />
but would like to be much more. I dare say you,<br />
dear reader, many years from now, shall be much more.</p>
