                <h3>They May Be Right</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>26 April 2023</small></small></em></p>  

<p>I was here before, but did not know it.<br />
Now I know, but that has not made me any wiser.<br />
See the lovers entwined on the beach before dawn.<br />
Unassuming teachers, little did they know that I saw.<br />
But rising beyond them the sea was a formless expanse.<br />
The light broke through the horizon and cracked the surface.<br />
I could not remember who I was waiting to meet.<br />
It was like every dawn in uniqueness, though still being dawn.<br />
As the lovers shuffled I saw ever clearer day coming.<br />
It was and was not meant for them, nor for me.<br />
The shadows grew longer but this time that just felt okay.<br />
The lovers departed before the full sun was in sight.<br />
I have never doubted the feeling that they may be right.</p>
