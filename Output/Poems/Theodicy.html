<p>The Nazis proved that God's law<br />
can be violated with impunity<br />
for a time. It was, after all, America<br />
who stopped them. God was mute.<br />
And if there still be any who would claim<br />
that Auschwitz fits some higher plan,<br />
I say I do not wish to serve such Planning<br />
or a God who makes such plans.<br />
With this, I often wonder<br />
if Herr Hitler has his final laugh,<br />
for though, of course, we beat them,<br />
one long draught of their Nepenthe<br />
has us losing our identity.<br />
They <em>proved</em> that God is silent<br />
in the midst of desperate anguish.<br />
Who believes now that he listens?<br />
Do the screams not matter much<br />
to his big mind? But let us alter here,<br />
and ask God what he is. We may be wrong<br />
without discarding years of questions. We may ask<br />
without demanding certain answers. We may think<br />
without deciding in advance. Must God use reason? Why?</p>
