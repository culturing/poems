<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>22 April 2020</small></small></em></p>  

<p><em>Awaking comes in turns,</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>the day is bright before it burns.</em>  </p>

<p>I walk down streets I never knew.<br />
They are familiar, but I, the knower, have changed.<br />
I did not know what little I knew.<br />
Maybe this is what poets mean by recurrence,<br />
why they return so often to the same things.<br />
I did not know the familiar streets<br />
because I, the knower, had not yet been changed.<br />
But what can bring such a change?<br />
An encounter, a question, another knower?<br />
To know is to be known and vice versa.<br />
This means the streets must know me,<br />
and where the streets have no names<br />
there is nothing to know.<br />
But this is all begging the question,<br />
why knowledge?<br />
Because I, the knower, have not yet been changed.<br />
Maybe this is why poets recur and recur.<br />
If change comes it comes only for now, not forever,<br />
and so I walk down streets I never knew,<br />
the same streets, but I, the knower, have changed,<br />
and so have they.</p>
