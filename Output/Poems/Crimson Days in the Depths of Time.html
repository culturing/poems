                <h3>Crimson Days in the Depths of Time</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>29 November 2022</small></small></em></p>  

<p>Into the sea he dove, toward another land,<br />
this one no less deplorable, unneutered, never filtered,<br />
and he swam. The currents pushed and pulled his form,<br />
and twisting, writhing, he found sand, the stuff of mountains<br />
long eroded, then descended. Were these not the sands<br />
of time, at last, now freed here from their hourglasses?<br />
Time would tell, as only time could tell.<br />
And so he fell, but falling, not as out of Eden,<br />
rather falling as one drawn to depths by kinship<br />
to those depths, or maybe drawn by some dark gravity.<br />
Leviathan in chains, he feared, would wait for him down there,<br />
or so they say, but on this day he little cared<br />
what fate awaits him, little cared for self at all<br />
when put against the call to sink or fall below the waves.<br />
In crimson days, in patterened waves, he feared the rise<br />
of troubled years, nor dared to counter them with tears,<br />
for they demanded something more, a new beginning,<br />
if a new path could be won, and so he dove<br />
to chart a course, lay some foundation. He struck<br />
rock the second time, this not surprising. He<br />
had heard of rock before, though never seen it.<br />
These he saw, and knew at once that they<br />
could serve him. He delved hard, and threw himself<br />
against the rocks, and when few broke, he knew again<br />
that these were firm. But when he moved them,<br />
when he placed one on another, both proved worthless,<br />
turned to sand. He groaned, but, still resolved, took sand<br />
and pressed it in his hands, until as glass it stayed.<br />
He now had made his way, and none could take it,<br />
so he claimed, but came a rumble from those depths<br />
of things forgotten, drifting memories of all that sand<br />
has been. This troubled him, his glass was cracked,<br />
but there could be no going back. He cut his hands there,<br />
leaving drops of blood reflecting throughout time, and<br />
though those depths had proved unkind, it's said<br />
that he still loves them, like a child, like a patriot,<br />
to the end.</p>
