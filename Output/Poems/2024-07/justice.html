                <h3>Justice</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>27 July 2024</small></small></em></p>  

<p>How does one answer them, naked<br />
and screaming for more, when the task<br />
ever new yet the same, makes demands?<br />
One is rapt by Sophia, beloved of philosophy,<br />
whose darkness conceals all we know,<br />
and makes hidden suppos√©d self-evident truths.<br />
Evermore? Or shall we again find that thing<br />
that makes peoples cohere, nestled in us,<br />
right next to the beating heart? It's a start,<br />
but the task, ever new, makes demands,<br />
and we may find ourselves unequipped<br />
for its burdens, until we revisit<br />
our gardens of men, and equip them<br />
with sturdier material.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Child of darkness, darkness unverified,<br />
tell me your secrets, and I will make hidden<br />
what ought to be so. Let me guess. You are sure<br />
that the empire is falling and ought to fall.<br />
You have known all injustice. The beaker is full<br />
of the dregs of revenge, and mankind is no better<br />
than its worst have been. You will say this,<br />
but time goes on, turning its wheel,<br />
as you squeal and you moan about nothing<br />
not already known by all those who have lived.<br />
For you will not survive here unless<br />
you can learn to forgive.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Turning and turning the wheel that keeps turning,<br />
we know now that all Rome is burning,<br />
was burning, and always shall burn<br />
'til we learn that we are not pure atoms<br />
but live here as one holy tribe.<br />
It is hard to describe what I mean,<br />
but not so far beyond that it cannot be grasped,<br />
if one only had what one first came for,<br />
so long ago, out of the ether and into this world<br />
of mankind gone awry. But whence comes this true hope<br />
for a justice no earth-dweller knows?</p>
