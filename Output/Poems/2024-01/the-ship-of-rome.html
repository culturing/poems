                <h3>The Ship of Rome</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>12 January 2024</small></small></em></p>  

<p>Let me sing for you about the ship of Rome,<br />
which crashed at Plymouth, spilling gods and heroes<br />
to the sea. 'Twas not for you and me, that pantheon,<br />
and yet we took that wreckage and built homes.<br />
Did we not know the walls would talk, thus carved<br />
from holy wood? They say strive harder,<br />
on toward the unseen end of gloria, whence we shall be gods.<br />
Did we not know the ship had crashed? That we, too, crash,<br />
and always crash, so long as we rely on only worn-out navigation?  </p>

<p>Let the augurs rest, no, let them die,<br />
and let all children of the sky fortell<br />
their own fate, falling faster than sweet Icarus,<br />
to soon with Hades lie. But this old feud<br />
is not worth reappearing, will not settle on these terms.<br />
I crave a new word, <em>after</em> Rome, but not<br />
<em>instead</em> of Rome, for who could pluck such mighty organs<br />
out of this, her organism? Surely this beast<br />
has a heart, so we won't start to prophesy<br />
some doom ordained by civic need<br />
and furthered on by bloodlust. No,<br />
we want some answers for all misdeeds<br />
done by smiling men with good intentions<br />
and reputed names. It is the same, the same, the same,<br />
no matter how the poor are skinned,<br />
the plot remains, who does the skinning,<br />
and are they held to account? One doubts<br />
sincerely, and another has philosophy, but these<br />
are even older than the crimes, and have done little<br />
to assuage the unjust blood. Is it not time?<br />
The ship, alas! may hold more corpses than we know.<br />
But this will grow: take heart from this:<br />
by now there have been other ships.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Will you listen? I have seen behind the curtain<br />
and the man I saw is ugliger than imagined.<br />
He spoke croakingly, without a point or purpose,<br />
flailing madly, with twin sceptres in his hands,<br />
and pedalled briskly on the bike that turns the world.<br />
I won't describe his face. All has its place,<br />
except for him, the mastermind of chaos,<br />
tossing here and there the pieces of our lives.  </p>

<p>We dare not thrive, in this, his world,<br />
and so we're cured, or so we're told,<br />
but somewhere someone must remember<br />
how to live...  </p>

<p>At first, you give, and only then<br />
dare to receive, for this, your need<br />
to be a giver is the stronger.<br />
Doubt not any longer. Love<br />
is not the answer, though it is<br />
part of the question, as new ships<br />
come in from ever distant shores.<br />
Don't hold off anymore. You have been<br />
changed already, as you know,<br />
and as these winds begin to blow,<br />
depart, and set sail for yourself,<br />
so long ago. So you must go<br />
into the night the knowers know<br />
with many histories in tow.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>Augustus abolished wonder, that much is clear,<br />
and he did steer the ship of Rome for many years.<br />
Here on the other side, one sees how light can blind<br />
and is reminded of the fateful deaths of Socrates<br />
and Jesus, noble rebels, ever castaways on some<br />
lost seaside isle. But death solves nothing, only life<br />
can bring solution, as it mixes with all other life,<br />
diluting thus the brew. It's nothing new, although<br />
the solvents may be new, the process stands as it has stood.<br />
We guessed it would, when we based Science on a method.<br />
Let us wonder at this process, but think also<br />
that the ship's wreck has been salvaged not in full, but in part only,<br />
and that we may be still captive to its thrall.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>The ships from the East were a welcome sight,<br />
carrying treasure instead of soldiers, intending to awe<br />
without terror barbarians abroad. The carrot<br />
instead of the stick. But it would not stick<br />
in imperial hearts, proud with punishment, dizzy with wealth,<br />
though still <em>novi homines</em> in their own eyes. How to govern?<br />
It would not be long before questions had outstripped answers<br />
and the West would be overextended combatting the forces<br />
it thought to control. But those thoughts were all wrong,<br />
seen in time as the lies that they are, for we govern ourselves<br />
as we govern our friends. We won't treat ourselves any better,<br />
as creatures of habit, when habits are hard to unlearn<br />
or control. How to govern? The ships may return or may not,<br />
but our task is to learn all we can from them,<br />
not as their servants or masters, but simply as friends,<br />
with the knowledge that more wrecks will come<br />
and that we would not like to be among them.</p>
