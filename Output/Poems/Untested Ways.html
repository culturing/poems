                <h3>Untested Ways</h3>

<p style='margin:0; margin-top: -1.25rem'><em><small><small>29 November 2022</small></small></em></p>  

<p>I am wondering what will become of us,<br />
after all this time. I am wondering just<br />
how strange time is, and how strange<br />
we are, living here, at the end of it.<br />
We're aware now that Jesus never<br />
attended church, so we follow his footsteps<br />
at last, but what of it? I suspect<br />
there is more to this story, and until<br />
we get down to the bottom of it,<br />
I wonder if we will find peace.<br />
There are many paths forward, but each<br />
is a severance from what precedes.<br />
This is saying the road does end here,<br />
but some new ones begin. I think I<br />
shall explore a few untested ways,<br />
for your sake, and for mine. This way,<br />
one of us at least keeps moving.</p>
