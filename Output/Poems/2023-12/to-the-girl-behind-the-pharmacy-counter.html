                <h3>To the Girl Behind the Pharmacy Counter</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>18 December 2023</small></small></em></p>  

<p>You with the smile, asking favors with eyes only,<br />
yes, I remember you too. But this is not the time<br />
for a dance or the courting of pairs. You have asked me<br />
to take my time, and I shall, as I linger over<br />
what time has brought me. Not the east, or the sun,<br />
but just you, with all faults still at this moment concealed.<br />
Shall we remember fondly this meeting when hours of argument<br />
wrangle our spirits, or when we find habits distasteful<br />
which each of us cannot change? Yes, we shall, with disdain,<br />
for it's always the same, as the first blush transforms<br />
to the flush of rage, for we puppets on Nature's marionette.<br />
You can bet it will happen again, as it's happened before,<br />
even here, and to us, as we each go our ways<br />
through the spasms of time. But this is not the time for a lesson, either,<br />
when those eyes ask questions no poet could describe.<br />
So here is my answer. I cannot divulge all my purposes<br />
nor share with fellow traveller the path I have chosen.<br />
So adieu, night-wanderer. May you find a home<br />
and a love worth your while.</p>
