                <h3>Belly of the Whale</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>11 July 2022</small></small></em></p>  

<p>Consumed by the fool's errand of making life painless,<br />
we could never be bothered to think<br />
along lines that were not predetermined,<br />
defined by the will of the faceless consumers<br />
like us, who ran everything. Speechless,<br />
we floundered through chaos and form,<br />
but from time to time one had to wonder<br />
what all of it meant, else succumb<br />
to the roar of consumption<br />
enduring through slogans and signs<br />
and most firmly in minds made of mud<br />
baked like stone. I was never a part of this,<br />
never aligned with the spineless<br />
who bear no weight, who will crack under any demand,<br />
for demanding betrays their life's purpose.  </p>

<p>Again, these are errands for fools, but of course<br />
fools speak louder than thinkers and rule all<br />
but auspicious places, those private lands<br />
governed by men who will tolerate no more,<br />
who instead choose to stretch themselves out before knowing<br />
and learn what the gods have in store.  </p>

<p>The beatings continue, morale doesn't care,<br />
and one wonders how punishment ever was thought<br />
to cure suffering, or how anyone stands it.<br />
But stand it they do, if they must.<br />
Deeper silence where agony once named a people.<br />
How now to take heart and oppose this new ocean of troubles,<br />
or else turn to brooding for future's sake?  </p>

<p>I sing from the belly of the whale,<br />
which pursues its perfection for all,<br />
which leaves open no quarter for others,<br />
which swallows each culture in all,<br />
which cares nothing for time past or future,<br />
whose whiteness is barely a memory,<br />
whose grayness is given by all.  </p>

<p>With the hour both hidden and late,<br />
I cry out for the sea-foam to hear me.</p>
