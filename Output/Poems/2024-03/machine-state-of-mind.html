                <h3>Machine State of Mind</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>22 March 2024</small></small></em></p>  

<p>The problem with machines is they never change.<br />
So we must simply have less of them,<br />
having them only where they are most needed<br />
and thus most effective. The mindless rote tasks,<br />
the menial labors, the painful tediums: these<br />
the machines may alleviate. But why did we ever<br />
believe they could help us connect or find love?<br />
It may be that our deepest, our bedrock identity<br />
(here in America) always was tied to machines<br />
and their state of mind. Our Constitution sits,<br />
nigh a quarter-millennium after inception, there tempting us<br />
never to change, though a change comes, it comes<br />
and it always comes, from beyond the horizon.<br />
But it's not here now. We have kept it away<br />
with machines and their promises, so often kept<br />
that we dare not examine their failures, lest we also<br />
slide into failure with them, as so many ancestors have before.</p>
