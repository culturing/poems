                <h3>The Task of Man</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>22 March 2024</small></small></em></p>  

<p>Let us turn the page here, and let us ask<br />
who we shall be, and know we have a say,<br />
for time, though strong, is neither master nor enemy,<br />
but friend. It's time we think, if we dare think at all,<br />
and only time makes worthy those<br />
who rise before its call. So let us turn<br />
and rise and make a better life, that they may say<br />
that here a few stood tall who were not daunted<br />
by the task of man, who faced it with all courage<br />
even as dark winds were blowing.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>The poets are singing again, about how cultures blend<br />
and one fades into another, across the sands of time,<br />
which litter the desert of peoples, lost and forgotten,<br />
yet ever new, like the rising sun. Does that sun parch<br />
or does it vivify? Only time will tell, we know that well,<br />
although we also know ourselves, and possibly only that.<br />
But poets sing regardless, knowing that this too shall pass,<br />
that all must pass, but most of all this ratiocentric<br />
obsession with self, with reason, with power, which plagues<br />
this hour with Man so magnified nothing else breaks through.  </p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>But what else is there? Only God? And Nature?<br />
We, no longer children, will not take our fairy-tales,<br />
but crave more solid food, the real meat of the matter.<br />
But too bad for us, the stories are the meat,<br />
and always were, and our mancenteredness is only<br />
one more story. C'est la vie. Back to the task,<br />
as ever, editing, revising, and then publishing the draft<br />
that we've received as our inheritance. But let's make it<br />
a good one, not a tragedy or farce, but one<br />
with heroes in their prime and worthy deeds.</p>
