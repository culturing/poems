                <h3>Speak It Out Loud</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>22 March 2024</small></small></em></p>  

<p>Let it be remembered<br />
that the stasis grew impenetrable,<br />
that each side fought to kill<br />
but weakened slowly, that the dawn<br />
came ever closer but was not known,<br />
that mankind in the twenty-first century<br />
stayed unsure, despite its patina of knowledge,<br />
and lest we be informed, we also grow<br />
toward that dawn, because time moves us<br />
out of Progress, into homes manmade and durable.  </p>

<p>The living commences then with a story<br />
about how we got here, through chaos and also<br />
executive action, which foists upon common people<br />
feelings and thoughts known to dazzle great minds.<br />
Bamboozled thus, all wander aimlessly, doubting<br />
that aims could exist or that any who champion them<br />
have any motive but domination. If only they knew<br />
about history, like that it exists, or that others have lived<br />
other ways and still prospered, sometimes more than we.<br />
But such things cannot be under this dark dominion,<br />
the spectre of progress asleep at the wheel, like the God<br />
that it claims to displace...  </p>

<p>This disgrace is expiring, but what takes its place<br />
it's not my place to say. Let the ones who will follow<br />
decide what to call it. I only speak now, but I speak it out loud.</p>
