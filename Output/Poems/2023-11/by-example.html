<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>23 November 2023</small></small></em></p>  

<p>In the seventh year of the reign of Trump,<br />
we are floundering, just like before, as the businessmen<br />
sell us our candy and hula hoops, and government<br />
roves in search of destroying production. One wonders<br />
where all of the flourishing humans are, why<br />
none of their concerns matter here, in an empire<br />
now far out and well on its way, toward what? If the coming election<br />
brings blood, you may say that I warned you, but I think you knew it<br />
already, though it may lie buried by mountains of nonsense<br />
and oceans of shame. All the same, we strive on toward glory<br />
and know not whence hope comes nor whether our lives can be tamed,<br />
whether here in America still lives that germ of empowerment<br />
that once, twice, and hence fuels revolt, and if so, whither,<br />
where it will go, in the body in which we are parts. If we know<br />
that the swamp has its sickness, malarial as always, that sickness<br />
is sabotage, the purposeful undermine of confidence, always and everywhere,<br />
and not in the spirit of philosophy proper (which by its very name<br />
implies friendship) but rather with sick dialectics, designed to kill masters<br />
and liberate slaves. It turns out that the masters know better<br />
(to no one's surprise) and without them we're nothing, although<br />
the enslaving did get a little out of hand. But is mastery itself<br />
to blame? Or is competance simply essential to flourishing?<br />
No, there are ways to progress unlike this, with less venom,<br />
with generous friendship from first to last, by example.</p>
