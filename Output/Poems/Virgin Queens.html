                <h3>Virgin Queens</h3>

<p style='margin:0; margin-top: -1.25rem'><em><small><small>28 June 2022</small></small></em></p>  

<p>Nobody can hurt a man more than his wife,<br />
except maybe his mother. They simply<br />
have more opportunity, knowing<br />
where all of the pain points are, because they,<br />
on good days, massage there. That is<br />
one kind of love, but another is<br />
taking in stride all the pain dealt<br />
by mother and wife, so that all can belong.<br />
After all, only suffering brings us together,<br />
as all women know. They require it.<br />
I've come to remind you of this, so that you,<br />
unlike many, avoid the allure of false dreams,<br />
which would make virgin queens out of maidens.  </p>
