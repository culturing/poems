                <h3>Planting Time</h3>

<p style='margin:0; margin-top: -1.25rem'><em><small><small>14 February 2021</small></small></em></p>  

<p>In the spring time of the year,<br />
as dawn rises, dusty, over the fields,<br />
I wait, anxious, with my plow.  </p>

<p>It has come again, the time for planting,<br />
but this crop is strange to me.<br />
The soil is like all soil, firm but supple,<br />
and I am like all planters,<br />
firm but supple.  </p>

<p>Tomorrow rains will come,<br />
and old seed wash away<br />
as new seed takes its root,  </p>

<p>And who will then be standing here<br />
in plantersâ€™ shoes<br />
to cast a growing shadow?  </p>

<p>I hope one who knows a little,<br />
treads with greater care.  </p>

<p>For people in the village,<br />
I plant days and years  </p>

<p>And see strange fruit come harvest time.<br />
I wait for what will grow.</p>
