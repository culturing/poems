                <h3>Hitler's Grave</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>17 August 2023</small></small></em></p>  

<p>I went to Hitler's grave the other day,<br />
just off the beaten path, through rows of trees,<br />
the smell of sulphur lingering. It was a quiet place,<br />
not oft disturbed, but on the stone I saw<br />
a clump of roses, dying though not dead.<br />
Someone had left them, as if hoping<br />
even here in man's best nature. I was touched<br />
and yet disturbed, but it occurred to me<br />
that Hitler may have liked the smell of roses<br />
or the sun upon his face, as we all do,<br />
and that his favor had not made these things less good,<br />
nor had his crimes. If we but had the time,<br />
we might rehearse his glory and his shame,<br />
but we are fading, through this age into the next,<br />
and soon this grave will not remain, replaced by new ones.<br />
What is left to say? I picked up the bouquet<br />
and plucked the rarest, left that one as a memento,<br />
brought the rest back to the living,<br />
where they may still do some good.</p>
