                <h3>More alarming by the day</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>08 March 2025</small></small></em></p>  

<p>Who is to answer them, the critics<br />
without a direction, the spineless destroyers,<br />
the miserable seeking company? Not more like them,<br />
not their progeny, not those in chains, but the free.<br />
We have made all men free, so we say,<br />
but it has not gone well, or at least<br />
it has been a mixed blessing, where most cling to freedom<br />
as devotees, as fervent and small-minded as any peasant,<br />
and who is to sing to or for them?<br />
Such a soul is not a place for song,<br />
being wracked with uncertainty and crushed by the burden<br />
of thinking through things on its own. Why despair?<br />
Even that is unhelpful, when men have been made<br />
more than useless by systems, demands, institutions<br />
that expect them to doubt what they are, although<br />
at the same time, to belong is in fact what they are.<br />
They are drawn to the group by instinct, but these groups<br />
proceed to destroy the group instinct. So what can we say?<br />
There is nothing to say, one would like to pass by,<br />
but this power becomes more alarming day by day.</p>
