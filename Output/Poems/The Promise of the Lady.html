                <h3>The Promise of the Lady</h3>

<p style='margin:0; margin-top: -1.25rem'><em><small><small>21 February 2023</small></small></em></p>  

<p>Come to the temple,<br />
the Lady is waiting,<br />
with courtesans towing<br />
the train of her robe.<br />
She invites you to enter.<br />
She patiently gazes<br />
upon your small splendor<br />
but does not refuse you.<br />
Her form soft and slender<br />
invites you again<br />
to become what was promised<br />
long since at this temple.  </p>

<p>The gateway before you,<br />
your form soft and nimble,<br />
she beckons you and you must go.<br />
But don't worry: her promise is good<br />
and her temple will still stand long after.</p>
