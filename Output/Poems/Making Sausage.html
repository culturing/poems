                <h3>Making Sausage</h3>

<p style='margin:0; margin-top: -1.25rem'><em><small><small>13 September 2021</small></small></em></p>  

<p>The bird has a story.<br />
It sounds like a song.<br />
But I wouldn't worry.<br />
He wouldn't sing long.  </p>

<p>The people are coming.<br />
They haven't a care.<br />
The people are stunning.<br />
The bird wouldn't dare.  </p>

<p>The people make sausage.<br />
What else could they do?<br />
Their story is ugly,<br />
But this much is true:  </p>

<p>The bird has to learn how to live with clipped wings.<br />
Indeed, this may be why he sings.</p>
