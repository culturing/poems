<p>"It is and it is not, and, therefore, is"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Wallace Stevens, <em>A Primitive Like an Orb</em>  </p>

<p>What have we learned in seventy years?<br />
What are the lessons of that war<br />
which lately ripped both Europe and Asia<br />
to pieces, that broke our faith, but left us here?<br />
If God is dead, what takes his place?<br />
Or must the place itself change, into<br />
something open, free for exploration, undefined?<br />
It is, is not, and therefore is,<br />
just like ourselves, our lives, and our surrounding aura.<br />
Who would dare to pin things down again?<br />
Yet how could beasts like us survive<br />
without restraint and limitation?<br />
We have known the pain of man and his machines<br />
on heaven's throne, have suffered Cromwell's vengeful reign<br />
for nigh four centuries. This war (the one succeeding,<br />
recall, the one to end all wars) is but the climax<br />
of the heavenly interregnum. But what <em>person</em><br />
dares to sit on such a throne again?<br />
Are we so human? Human still, despite our deepest cravings,<br />
loyal subjects to an absent king. Why can't we let God rest in peace?<br />
We hear the wind disturb the leaves, those covering his grave.<br />
It's us, the ones you chose to save,<br />
and then abandoned to the formless blur,<br />
which is, is not, and therefore is.<br />
Let's on with it, then, to the new frontier,<br />
where our longings are answered more plainly<br />
and with less fear.  </p>
