                <h3>Liberty and Justice</h3>

<p style='margin:0; margin-top: -1.25rem'><em><small><small>11 July 2022</small></small></em></p>  

<p>Someone should tell New England<br />
that God has not made up his mind<br />
about how to best organize life,<br />
nor should we, being free.<br />
But why freedom? What do we achieve<br />
in that ecstasy known by frontiersman,<br />
and by them alone? The achievement<br />
is justice, though fleeting it be,<br />
and it is not your grandfather's justice.<br />
Then liberty, justice, and us here and now,<br />
in the swirling of time, decide once and for all<br />
(not for long) how life <em>is</em>, what it <em>is</em>,<br />
and shall be. But how <em>free</em> shall we be?<br />
Free enough to revisit these questions<br />
posed back at the start, and all answers so far,<br />
with an eye to revision, but not revolution,<br />
assuming no violence is warranted, knowing<br />
that violence can never be totally barred,<br />
for it comes from a failure to question in depth<br />
and in time. So let's question. Thoreau<br />
may have been on to something, and so we may be,<br />
if we ask ever deeper what meaning dwells here,<br />
where we are. What is Liberty? Why it <em>and</em> Justice?<br />
Could either <em>be</em> without the other?</p>
