                <h3>With Great Justice</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>17 August 2023</small></small></em></p>  

<p>We were a people that never did wish to be led,<br />
having known all too well where paths lead and how<br />
leaders betray every confidence, sure as we were<br />
that negation was what kept things moving, we struggled<br />
to keep ourselves firm. But the sun always set<br />
of its own accord, unconcerned with our struggles<br />
and even providing false hope for a world ruled<br />
by cosmic order. Such hopes were a threat to the struggle<br />
and, therefore, ourselves, bent on instituting tyranny<br />
of various kinds. Oh how surely we knew what we knew,<br />
having mastered all lessons without even studying,<br />
graced as we must have been with inhuman strength.<br />
But a few in the wilderness still kept their tablets of stone,<br />
saying these, or if not, some like these, will one day<br />
restore order in a barren land, because savagery<br />
brings nothing new, but instead brings to rubble<br />
the works of a thousand years. The new order,<br />
whatever its form, will arise, and decay, and fall.<br />
After all, we are left where we started,<br />
both wary of leaders and craving them, both,<br />
it would seem, with great justice.</p>
