                <h3>The Drums of Alexander</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>20 March 2023</small></small></em></p>  

<p>Alexander stood finally tall on Persepolis<br />
burning. This was the vengeance Ionia craved,<br />
the dream of a thousand hoplites realized at last.<br />
But what was that wind? O great King,<br />
have you done this? And had you no doubts?<br />
Later on one will stand here and wonder<br />
as you failed to wonder. Were not these<br />
baths lovely, with children at play in the spring?<br />
Rubble now, though perhaps all ends thus,<br />
though perhaps not as swiftly as this.<br />
Have you done it, or does some Ahura<br />
still haunt these hallowed grounds? What was<br />
really at stake, basileus, in so much destruction?<br />
And why do I still hear your drums beating,<br />
louder now, over the Atlantic?</p>
