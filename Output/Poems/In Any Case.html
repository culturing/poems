<p>Those with the higher sense, who observe our way of life,<br />
can only say "it's all wrong" so many times before<br />
they go crazy, so most just stop saying it. But none<br />
can stop feeling it. Why, after all, make things permanent?<br />
Process is all, and the process itself is in process.<br />
Or am I repeating something said before?<br />
I am certain that this much is true, we know<br />
little, no more than our forebearers, and we all know<br />
how that all ended (or have we forgotten?) In any case,<br />
let me remind you that change can be friendly,<br />
but so can the law, so we'd better plant one foot in each.</p>
