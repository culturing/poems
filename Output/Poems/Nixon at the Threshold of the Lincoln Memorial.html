                <h3>Nixon at the Threshold of the Lincoln Memorial</h3>

<p style='margin:0; margin-top: -1.25rem'><em><small><small>13 January 2019</small></small></em></p>  

<p><em>Something that is completely clean can also be completely sterile</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Richard Nixon, <a href="https://www.nixonlibrary.gov/sites/default/files/virtuallibrary/recordings/dictabelts/DB075_01.mp3">Dictabelt 75</a>, May 1970  </p>

<p>What language could there have been<br />
between that tiger, battle-scarred,<br />
and these young cubs, German-tongued<br />
and fearful offspring of Philosophy in ruins?  </p>

<p>Ah, one tries to merge with Being as the sky collapses.<br />
Those with thorny crowns spy deep oppression.  </p>

<p>Nixon mutters, “What is there to save?”<br />
allows no motion, grins a grin that says<br />
“All shall be well, stop feeling.”  </p>

<p>This has happened before.  </p>

<p>I stood there as a child<br />
repeating “up steps!” in innocence,<br />
for I had not yet learned what there is said<br />
of History or Freedom,<br />
or the other vague ideas men have died for.  </p>

<p>I was born too late for that,<br />
and though things have not changed<br />
some hope, yes, even now,<br />
though with less force,<br />
for some renewal,<br />
this time unendorsed.  </p>

<p>It will not come on wings<br />
or save us, probably,<br />
but it could make things better,<br />
keep them moving.  </p>

<p>And as for the children, well,<br />
they’ve never mattered much to us,<br />
and who could build a home from such raw material?</p>
