<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>29 October 2023</small></small></em></p>  

<p>Philosophers are the leaves of the family tree,<br />
not seeking to start new branches, absorbing sunlight<br />
to nourish the rest of the tree. It begs the question<br />
whether life is, as they suspect, a torture chamber<br />
with no reward for participation, or whether the sun,<br />
in fact, demands to see a show. I wouldn't know,<br />
although the view among the trees is charming<br />
this time of the year, as all the leaves are changing,<br />
turning yellow, red, and brown, in preparation for<br />
the dying of the sun. When day is done, and when<br />
the summer fully fails, the leaves remain a blanket<br />
on the ground, which at least fertilizes<br />
all the coming trees. But more importantly,<br />
the leaves sustained the tree through one more season<br />
of the carnage of the air, always aware<br />
that their own purpose lay in growing future trees<br />
through self-demise, and not in nursing these<br />
that happen to be present, rather yearning,<br />
rather reaching for that sunlight, which replenishes the earth<br />
from time to time.</p>
