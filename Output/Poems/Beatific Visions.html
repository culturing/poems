                <h3>Beatific Visions</h3>

<p style='margin:0; margin-top: -1.25rem'><em><small><small>16 July 2022</small></small></em></p>  

<p>I doubt those people on television<br />
realize they're dressed like angels,<br />
calling us back to a realm we reject,<br />
and I think it's a bit out of place<br />
to put these hopes in masters of commerce,<br />
when such hopes are sky-born or nothing.<br />
What see we in movie stars anyway?<br />
Billboards, book covers, and internet ads<br />
still elicit our peasant repentance.<br />
What for? For not being divine enough,<br />
same as before, and yet let me explain:<br />
none are holy. You're made it this far,<br />
you must know that by now.  </p>

<p>It's amazing, isn't it, just how much<br />
<em>thought</em> there has been about everything.  </p>

<p>Thereby I wander, but what does it mean<br />
to be <em>lost</em> in a <em>place</em> that is lost?<br />
It means everything. Stand here with me<br />
and observe that at last<br />
all the cracks in the firmament<br />
outline a God-shaped void.  </p>

<p>We are ready for solid food,<br />
culled from earth,<br />
even that which comes only through violence.</p>
