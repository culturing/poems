                <h3>Reasonable Measure</h3>

<p style='margin:0; margin-top: -1.25rem'><em><small><small>16 July 2022</small></small></em></p>  

<p>At the end of life's journey<br />
I awoke, not aware yet<br />
of where my road had taken me,<br />
but brightness lit my mind up<br />
like a flame. I'll never be the same.<br />
Discursive Reason failed us. Here we wait<br />
for some new measure to make chaos<br />
something straight, without demanding<br />
that it wear the guise of form.<br />
I beg to differ, if by differing<br />
I bring new thoughts to table,<br />
and as far as I am able,<br />
guide our way. But beggars all<br />
would trade their place for one<br />
in heaven, yet to me that path is barred,<br />
so I use reason in new ways,<br />
feet deep in earth, head free of daemons,<br />
closing in on what it means to be here now,<br />
where I awoke, at journey's end.  </p>

<p>Across the sea, I glimpse an image,<br />
be it shade or beast or otherwise,<br />
I only know its visage.<br />
But it calls me with its message,<br />
like a work of human craft.<br />
I say, deception is insidious.<br />
I tell this lonesome image<br />
to release my gaze to this shore,<br />
where I make my only home.  </p>

<p>But what home is, I cannot say,<br />
nor can this homely image tell me.  </p>
