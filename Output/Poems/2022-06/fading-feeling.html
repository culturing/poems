                <h3>Fading Feeling</h3>

<p style='margin:0;'><em><small><small>18 June 2022</small></small></em></p>  

<p>In our pecular way,<br />
we were always ones<br />
striving for form, and by form<br />
we meant something enduring,<br />
unchanging, but how much upheaval<br />
and violence it took to learn<br />
how now this striving must change.  </p>

<p>For Helen's sake, let us remember<br />
the ways of our fathers,<br />
sea-tossed as they always were,<br />
reaching from darkness<br />
like tentacles on Ocean's floor.  </p>

<p>We are like them now, and must be,<br />
having seen once for all<br />
the formation of cracks<br />
in the old Greek edifice,  </p>

<p>And thus we must not always be,<br />
knowing full well that not every Greek<br />
bearing gifts can be trusted, but also that<br />
we are not trustworthy either, so long as<br />
we think with stiff minds, and that after all<br />
this is what Plato meant. But in our peculiar<br />
Greek way we are stiff like ones trained for a phalanx,<br />
though soft and bourgeois enough,<br />
not fitting in with ourselves, and not really<br />
belonging here either, no better than anywhere--  </p>

<p>Thus we must not always be,<br />
we must fade, like a breeze on a soft summer night,<br />
or the call of an eagle near mountains,<br />
and make some new way for the feeling to come.  </p>
