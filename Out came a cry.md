Out came a cry\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from beneath the great Nothing,\
but no one was there to believe it.

An oomph went woomph,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the meaning went missing,\
and no one was there to retrieve it.

And day was like sand,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the moon went away,\
and nobody was there to be free with.
