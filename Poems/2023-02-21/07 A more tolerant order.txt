A more tolerant order
21 February 2023

We cannot replace law with tolerance,
however much we try. I suggest instead
aiming for a more tolerant order, a law
that *embraces* diversity but does not enforce it.
For tolerance never puts bread on the table,
though lawfulness can, through cooperation (and
don't be deceived that cooperation comes through
more tolerance). Laws create trust and cohesion
but also cause friction where not all agree.
It may be that universal laws must be few,
but I hope we agree that our mutual survival
is something worthwhile, to be cherished.
