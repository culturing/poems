Rest Unassured
21 February 2023

With the shadows dawning, with dawn descending,
I call for you, weeping, alone in the meadow,
with words for renewal. I say rest unassured,
be aware but not pure. There are days on horizons
not noticed before. As for us, it could be that
this setting defines us, but that is no reason to wallow.
