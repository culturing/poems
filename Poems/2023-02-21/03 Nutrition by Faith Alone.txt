Nutrition by Faith Alone

In America we believe God somehow powers
our food with his majesty, making infallible
all of our culinary experiments.
Call it Nutrition by Faith Alone. All that matters
is that *we believe*, as if no thing has substance,
as if, to use Plato mistakenly, thoughts are more real than things.
But we doubt that, and say so, but know of know other.
I wonder what Asia would think?
