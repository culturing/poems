The Promise of the Lady
21 February 2023

Come to the temple,
the Lady is waiting,
with courtesans towing
the train of her robe.
She invites you to enter.
She patiently gazes
upon your small splendor
but does not refuse you.
Her form soft and slender
invites you again
to become what was promised
long since at this temple.

The gateway before you,
your form soft and nimble,
she beckons you and you must go.
But don't worry: her promise is good
and her temple will still stand long after.
