### Rosie

Rosie works\
so hard\
to please the factory man.

It is a matter of time.

She has been on hands and knees\
since seventeen,

And does not know\
what moves her so,

To longing, maybe, for something.

Meanwhile\
somewhere blossoms,

but she cannot go,\
for it is a matter of time,

though she does know\
the way things grow.
