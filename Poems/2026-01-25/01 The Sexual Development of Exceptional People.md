The Sexual Development of Exceptional People
25 January 2026

It's well known that sexual development requires a spark,
the appearance of a suitable partner. But less well considered
are the problems this causes exceptional people, who require exceptional candidates
to light their fire. Through no fault of their own, they remain
undeveloped, awaiting ignition, unable to find it...rare persons
by definition are hard to find. So what can a rare person do?
They can cope. They can wait. They can hope. But the odds remain slim, for the sparks
only come from outside...and when one does come, it may come
as a shock, which requires some adjustment, though it comes with euphoria too.
