Prepared To Make Good
25 January 2026

The mists of time close over, clench what has been
in the vice of tomorrow, the permanent movement, the changing gods...
what are we, their children? How little they care for us! How little
we care for ourselves...I would walk out into the clearing
and shout, making way for whatever we are...tell the mists to part
for however long we can sustain the effort. This way we might live
for a while at least. This way we might stand
and be men and women, awake to our burdens, alert
to the dangers within and without, and prepared to make good
of ourselves.
