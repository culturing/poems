Odds of Success
25 January 2026

I would guarantee success if I could, but you and I
both know that would be a lie. The success is possible,
but the guarantee is not. It's a gamble each time, and the risk
is what makes it exciting. But know this, our odds of success
are high, so high that not taking this risk seems foolish.
Expect no perfect assurances, only the earnest desire
of a man who has found what he wants.
