*New Mountain
25 January 2026

I am brimming with words again, words for you
and for the universe...I have emptied myself on these pages
with no regrets, and now none can forget how we came
to believe in each other, across space and time,
with all meter and rhyme discarded, as needed,
before this new mountain we climb.
