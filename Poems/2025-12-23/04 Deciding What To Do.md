*Deciding What To Do
23 December 2025

I never told you how you caught my eye.
It was a strange event. You were a sprite,
at least in play, but even so I saw a sweetness
as of one who suffers. Do you? You were gifted
but still humble, not a diva, not afraid to be silly.
Then there were the signs. You mentioned gluten
(our shared enemy) and left me
with a dance to a tune about sudden love.
I had no hope of escape (believe me,
I tried), and so, obeying the gods, I called on you.
Now here we are, deciding what to do.
