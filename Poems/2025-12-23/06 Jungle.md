Jungle
23 December 2025

I must now measure my growth by the hour,
so rapidly do these changes overtake me,
but nothing is more exhilarating, more invigorating
than growing at an accelerated pace. Even so,
I will likely find reasons to pare back these growths along the way.
I do not wish to live in a jungle.
