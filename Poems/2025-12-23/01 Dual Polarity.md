*Dual Polarity
23 December 2025

What was the meaning of those signs with dual polarity,
both yes and no? Was confusion the meaning? I must think so.
But confusion can find its way to the water, and find
that this well hath no poison. Of course, one must doubt, to be sure,
but a day comes when doubts have been answered and hopes emerge.
I can dream of that day, as I sense the first glimpses of daybreak
across the horizon. I want to invite you to stand here with me,
in this light, near these waters. I want you to sing of things past
and things passing and things to come, with yourself mixed within them.
I want that song in my life, every part of it, now and forever.
But what am I saying? Can these things be? The confusion is not quite assuaged.
