The Central Dream
23 December 2025

Are we both cynical romantics? Big dreamers who have learned
to fear the bigness of our dreams? We may work well together then.
We'll burst each other's bubbles as required. But we must not fear
the central dream, the one where love endures and serves as an anchor
in a stormy sea. That dream is real, and makes the rest worthwhile.
