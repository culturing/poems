The Flux
23 February 2024

If you really want to know what you are doing,
you will have to discern velocities, and not supposedly
immutable actualities. Flux is the friend of philosophers,
even of Plato, and thinking is just this: observing potentials
and projecting their future interactions. But most cannot do this,
and therefore most quail before indecision, as though it were
insurmountable evil. The thinkers, meanwhile, must keep all of their thoughts
to themselves, lest the noisy potentials discomfit the slumber of all,
while these secretly crave after flux, which they know as a god,
and *make sense of it*, to the dismay and chagrin of the rest.
