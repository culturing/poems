No More
23 February 2024

Something in the soul cries out, "No more!"
against the lies, the toxic products, the malaise,
the lack of meaning, the addictions. How much more
will be endured before walls fall, and men find
hope again, and will it be true hope, or will
it lie again in time? I fear the worst, but is the best
so much improved that it won't also burn to ash
just when it's needed? I don't know, and I don't trust
those who do claim to know, but something in the soul
now stirs, and those who feel it tremble like those
waiting for the savage hordes to flow.
