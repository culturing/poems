True Healing
23 February 2024

I have often thought over how
in Eastern Christianity, sin is considered
a sickness to be healed, instead of
a violation to be punished. Much follows
from this, like how we blame the victim,
or really consider all sufferers to blame.
Could anything be less effective than punishment
if the goal is the curing of misery?
Thus our reformation, in the face of the most
ineffectual healing. We must break this habit
and restore to society places of healing,
true healing, which do not turn face and attack.
