A Time is Coming
23 February 2024

A time is coming (it always comes)
when men forget themselves and punish others
in an effort to remember. Let us here recall
ourselves and stave off terror, lest it come
(time as my witness) as it always does,
and let us be not blamed, for though
the seas will rise and fall, we heard them call,
and tried to warn the sleeping masses
of their graves (we did not dig them),
where the floods will carry all
who dare to build on sinking sands.

Let it be remembered that here stood one
both firm and tall amidst the early gusts of storm,
and though this marker may be worn,
it holds a heart that may revive a nation,
even one so torn.
