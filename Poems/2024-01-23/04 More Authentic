*More Authentic
23 February 2024

Something changed a hundred years ago,
but was it the machines or was it our
collective unbelief, the signs of chaos poking through?
Amidst the dollars breeding dollars, men found
mysteries, and wondered, is this all, or are
new thoughts around the bend? Some still pretend
that worn out Order could revive, and others
dance in naked revelries, but we are not
who *they* were, so it seems. These changes mount
toward their climax, and it will be more authentic,
but it will not save us from the gasping seas.
