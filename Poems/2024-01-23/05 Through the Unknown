Through the Unknown
23 February 2024

If I venture out through the unknown,
will you follow, or will you deny yourself
freedom? Think not what you will, but what is,
and thus free yourself from the dominion of
power, awakened at last to the mysteries,
life's strange embrace, and the colors of all
that has been or will be. Do you see?
These are waiting for you, just beyond the heart's door.
Yearn no more, be at peace, find release, and let be what shall be.
