*Only in the Waiting
20 November 2025

I have waited and will wait. I know what waiting means.
I know what longing means, but also
now I know what hope means. And I cannot look away.
If not today, some other day, some other time and place,
there she and I will meet and both be free. I know
no other road, I know no other hope. This waiting
answers every question with a calm repose, it dares
to let a feeling be exposed, against the silence,
and it knows what comes to pass before it comes.
There is no explanation. Only in the waiting is it known.
