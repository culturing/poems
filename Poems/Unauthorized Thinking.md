"You'd make me laugh if it wasn't forbidden."

So I've discovered Plotinus.  
Have you never heard?  
He has shaped your own words.  

He is waiting to meet us,  
but don't be absurd.  
He would never disturb

for me put them there.  
What a curious bird.

All I want  
is mystical union  
with the Absolute --  

is that too much to ask?

Augustine doles out freely  
fruits of Temple and Academy  
with no thought  
for the plants on which they grow.
