In Any Case
29 November 2022

Those with the higher sense, who observe our way of life,
can only say "it's all wrong" so many times before
they go crazy, so most just stop saying it. But none
can stop feeling it. Why, after all, make things permanent?
Process is all, and the process itself is in process.
Or am I repeating something said before?
I am certain that this much is true, we know
little, no more than our forebearers, and we all know
how that all ended (or have we forgotten?) In any case,
let me remind you that change can be friendly,
but so can the law, so we'd better plant one foot in each.
