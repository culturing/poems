Untested Ways
29 November 2022

I am wondering what will become of us,
after all this time. I am wondering just
how strange time is, and how strange
we are, living here, at the end of it.
We're aware now that Jesus never
attended church, so we follow his footsteps
at last, but what of it? I suspect
there is more to this story, and until
we get down to the bottom of it,
I wonder if we will find peace.
There are many paths forward, but each
is a severance from what precedes.
This is saying the road does end here,
but some new ones begin. I think I
shall explore a few untested ways,
for your sake, and for mine. This way,
one of us at least keeps moving.
