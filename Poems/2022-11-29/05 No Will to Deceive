No Will to Deceive
29 November 2022

God has grown neurotic these last few centuries,
ravaged by ships sailing seas where no ships had dared
dream before, but this is nothing, just men chasing power,
yet power is what makes God go. Are we listening now?
I remember, I can never forget, how the days before ours
were like fire in the night, but the night lasted longer
and swallowed that flame. We're the same when we ask 
for forever, though knowing full well it's beyond us. Where we live
time reigns, and the best we can do is believe. I can
only remind you again and again, but I'll do that
with grace in my heart and no will to deceive.
