The Gospel According to Us
29 November 2022

If you'll listen, I will tell you
of the day before the stars were born
like yesterday, but more in tune with now.
This is the gospel according to us,
not some forgotten fairy-tale
from days gone by, but this here now
by us for us. This is our gospel,
by the power of consensus, reigning free
across America, where we decree
what each thing is and dare 
no other. We have tasted majesty
from sea to shining sea, now dare
to speak, and be not worried
if this flag speaks not for thee.
We'll make it speak, with every fiber
of each being, named by us
and therefore there, existing solely
for ourselves, who, speaking, make the world
of images derived from prior times, the sea
of echoes pouring through our lives
as history. Are these not also here,
informing things? Are we so free
that each decree becomes a law?
