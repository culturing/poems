Ave Maris Stella
29 November 2022

Stella, bathed in lapis, azure
waves of sky, pray tell me
whence thy rays of amber light?
Am I your child, or am I
self-made, as prophets say
who guide our way tonight?
If any be whose thoughts are free,
I say they well may think of thee
yet still be free, but more to those who find
some thing objectionable inside,
I write with hope to change their minds.
