No Entry Beyond
29 November 2022

We are free now after long bondage,
no longer seeking to mate with the Truth,
but instead care to *know* it, as thinkers,
not lovers. I dare say this was 
a very long time in coming, not empty
but full, at long last, of ourselves
and our families, countries, and tribes.
We are full of reality's emptiness,
brimming with void, and in love
with each other, as passion demands.
We are free, very free (can it be?)
We are wise beyond years, beyond tears,
beyond ghosts of some greater beyond
who no longer hold any sway here.
