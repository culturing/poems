Persuasion
29 November 2022

It is strange how our rulers
pretend to believe that they
serve us, as though we don't know
that each offering merely entangles
us more in their web. Still
we go on, each feeling prescribed
by the business of business,
but free! we are free! very free!
If that is what we call it
to be inauthentic or else.
Who could want any service
besides what is standard?
I tell you we could,
with a bit of persuasion.
