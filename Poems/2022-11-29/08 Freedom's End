Freedom's End
29 November 2022

I stand upon a precipice,
the great cliff white as snow,
and fear a darkness coming yonder
over fields we used to know.
The day is cool and feckless,
but the night is coming in,
and we are hungry, we are tired,
by the gravity of sin.
There are no words between us,
no embraces bring us home,
and in the darkness I descry
the end of all things we have known.
I am no meager prophet,
and this is no meager poem.
I believe in new beginnings
grown from darkness overgrown.
So take this next step with me.
Through the doorway we will wend
and walk along the newfound pathways
on the way to Freedom's End.
