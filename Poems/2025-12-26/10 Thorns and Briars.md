Thorns and Briars
26 December 2025

I think there is more than one way to arrive,
many paths that converge in the clearing where men,
fully grown, can accept life's true burdens and go on their own.
My path had many detours, but I think I learned
quite a lot, more than most, and I now have this burden
of knowledge, to go with my burden of insight.
I cannot regret it, there would be no point, but I can
still remember the struggle, the thorns and the briars,
a few of which cling to me still and I think always will.
But my body still works, and my mind is alert,
and I'll take on tomorrow with courage, if given the chance.
