Father Knows Best
26 December 2025

Father knows best, doesn't he, but maybe not this time,
not with so much on the line. He inspires a kind of hope,
a deadly hope, for a love made easy, free of negotiation.
All you have to do is accept his answers, true or not.
But you know what is true. You always have.
You have it in you. When the stars will not sit still
you know his will is not enough to bend reality,
that some truths are too true to be ignored.
But you must step with cautious care
into yourself, or else this vertigo
could strip you of your common sense.
I know the way. I've walked it.
But I cannot walk it for you.
You are bold to go, and brave.
There is a soul in you to save.
