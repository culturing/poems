Can It Make Us Happy?
26 December 2025

I would love you until the stars burn out.
I would hold you until my arms give way,
then lay with you until death or the end of time,
whichever comes first. And I'd have no regrets.
And the worst of it is I think you'd want this too.
Can it make us happy? Can anything less make us happy?
