*Quarter Moon
26 December 2025

A quarter moon dares me to ask bold questions,
half-exposed as if expecting more. But I look on.
I wanted what I wanted, and I want it still,
but not enough to beg. It has a leg up on me now,
perhaps, but one leg is enough, if both would cost
my self-control. O quarter moon, decide. Reveal your splendor
or descend again and hide, but leave me to my thoughts.
The darkest night cannot my heart make waver,
nor the fear of it one inch increase my favor.
