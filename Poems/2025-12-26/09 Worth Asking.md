*Worth Asking
26 December 2025

There was a time before I knew this kind of love,
and it was a dismal time, a "wriggling out of an egg,"
to borrow a phrase. But now I've arrived in a sudden rush
of you. How can it be true? It wasn't the blue,
it was under the blue, and under the skin too.
I had never known that you could exist, and now I do.
But that does not prove that this thing has a future.
That question is separate, and more complex.
But I think it's at least worth asking.
