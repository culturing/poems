*This Secret Warmth
26 December 2025

I don't know how this happened, nor does it matter.
I have warmed up to you, and only you
can know my thoughts and feelings, only you can access
this secret warmth, and share *your* secret warmth
in our secret place. Let's call it home.
It has no better name. Just let me feel you
for as long as it takes to melt the ice away.
