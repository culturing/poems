The Dance of Life
01 January 2026

She *is* the earth, she contains in her heart
all its secret vibrations, the hidden gyrations
of men and women, in embryo, waiting
for activation, and able to activate others.
What is this holy rhythm, this pulsing
of life through two bodies, infecting each other
with love, until they overflow? It is
the dance of life, the origin of all human beings,
and our destiny. No lid can contain it forever.
