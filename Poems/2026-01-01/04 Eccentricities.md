*Eccentricities
01 January 2026

I know that you changed the words.
I think I know where you got the new ones.
I know what that would mean.
You know you can *tell me* if you want to.
I think I want to. I would tell you too.
I don't find you strange, or at least 
I don't find you unworthy of love.
I would show you how worthy you are.
I would call you strong and brave.
I would tell you until you believe me.

--

It doesn't have to be a walk in the park.
It could be an experiment, designed to trigger growth.
There are two kinds of not being ready.
The first is unable to try.
The second can try and learn by trying and, thus, get ready.
It can be hard to tell these two things apart.
It's better to err on the side of caution.
But sometimes the growth has already begun
and must be seen through, given space to grow,
or else it becomes a cancer.

--

Shall I apologize for giving you space to grow?
It almost seems necessary. It has not been painless.
But I think I shall not. I think you will thank me too.
Still, love is not built on pain. I wish you quick healing,
but not so quick as to leave the work undone.

I believe I have seen this performance before,
or one like it. The delivery indeed is "strange".
It's unique to you, but some parts of this take are new.
Could it be you have weaved a tapestry
of me and you into something you hold very dear?
The resemblance is striking, this character *is* you,
or close enough that her words are like a totem.

If so, then what is your vow? How will you satisfy
the need that emerges painfully? It does not end well for Alma.
That does not mean it can't end well for you. But be careful.
Take care of yourself, of your heart, of your body.
These treasures, once lost, can be hard to recover.
But you may indeed be obliged to risk them on the road to experience.
Only you know. You must do what you have to do.
