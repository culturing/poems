*Uncharted Waters
01 January 2026

I think we have reached uncharted waters, the open sea
with infinities stretching before us. Which way shall we turn?
There's no going back, because even the way we came
was consumed by time's waters and now looks the same
as all others. The compass will do us no good, for the stars,
alas, have changed, and the earth's polarity shifts from negative
to positive. Must we guide ourselves? The rudder works,
and with the wind in our sails we might find our way, but to where?
To adventure. To possibility. Some lifetimes ago,
I embraced these waters, and often they've served me well,
just as long as I keep one foot at the ready to disembark
on land, should the opportunity arise.
