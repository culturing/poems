*Uncharted Waters
01 January 2026

I think we have reached uncharted waters, the open sea
with infinities stretching before us. Which way shall we turn?
There's no going back, because even the way we came
was consumed by time's waters and now looks the same
as all others. The compass will do us no good, for the stars,
alas, have changed, and the earth's polarity shifts from negative
to positive. Must we guide ourselves? The rudder works,
and with the wind in our sails we might find our way, but to where?
To adventure. To possibility. Some lifetimes ago,
I embraced these waters, and often they've served me well,
just as long as I keep one foot at the ready to disembark
on land, should the opportunity arise.

But there is opportunity here, on this land, near the house
with the laughter of children (or is it the howl of cats?)
Or of course we could set sail together and risk ourselves
on the ship of love, come what may. Or try both together,
the certain and the uncertain, or rather the uncertain wrapped in the certain
and forming its center? "I cannot say just what I mean,"
there's the rub, and the point: that chaos is in us, not out there
and never extinguished in here. But I think we do well
to contain it, and rule justly over it, when we can.

--

A love that is only certain brings only pain
as does one that's only uncertain. It must
be a dance of opposition, of yes and maybe and no,
the whole way through, in order to stay alive.
So then set sail, if only in the heart
and perhaps thereby chart these waters
for those who are still to come.
