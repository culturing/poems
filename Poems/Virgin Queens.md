Nobody can hurt a man more than his wife,  
except maybe his mother. They simply  
have more opportunity, knowing  
where all of the pain points are, because they,  
on good days, massage there. That is  
one kind of love, but another is  
taking in stride all the pain dealt  
by mother and wife, so that all can belong.  
After all, only suffering brings us together,  
as all women know. They require it.  
I've come to remind you of this, so that you,  
unlike many, avoid the allure of false dreams,  
which would make virgin queens out of maidens.
