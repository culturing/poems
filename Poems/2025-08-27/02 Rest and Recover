Rest and Recover
27 August 2025

It has served its purpose.
The stimulus, now nearly dry,
still excites contemplation,
but it's change is wrought.
It has done its job,
and the turmoil is over.

I am no longer who I was,
and can barely remember a time
when I was not as now.
But the change has been wrought
(I lived through it),
and any tomorrow will bring on
a new change. For now,
I must rest and recover.
