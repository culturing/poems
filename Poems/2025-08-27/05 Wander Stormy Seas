*Wander on Stormy Seas
27 August 2025

I saw your light
and your darkness, guessed
at what might be inside,
and felt amazed. But how
can the heart be so filled
by an honest mistake?
It's not true, and I knew,
but I could not stop
falling for you.
Now I tell you,
please take what I gave
and be strengthened,
but know I will never give more,
because I cannot settle my mind
into shapes that would set you at ease.

The heart of this poet
must wander on stormy seas.
