The Other Side
27 August 2025

Can anything come of it,
days, weeks, and countless hours
lost searching my soul for the embers
of love...if it came from above
it would hardly be so confusing.

And yet it did come,
and from somewhere, but where?
And what now? I am sure
that I'll never be sure.
There is folly in testing the ice,
but the prize, on an island of hope
at the center of frozen lakes of hell,
is unspeakable happiness, joy that confounds
the most clever machinations. Does that
give the answer? For now that I've glimpsed it,
how could I unglimpse it? And how
could I not at least test these solid waters,
this temporary land-bridge, to see what's on the other side?
