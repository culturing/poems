When a man loves
16 November 2025

When a man loves, it burns a hole
at the center of time, where no reason
or rhyme can contain the fire.

Atop the winding spire stands the Lady.
Thence he climbs, to soothe the burn
he sees reflected in her eyes.

But love is fickle and unkind.
The Lady turns and hides her eyes,
but he remembers and inquires.

She does not consent to worship
or vulgarity, but only to a love
that never tires.

He must offer it,
without her sweet reminding.
