*Meant For Your Ears
16 November 2025

I will take your hand, if you'll let me,
and show you the wideness of the world.
There is so much to see and understand,
so much to uncover, and you have made everything
shimmer with hope and with purpose.
For you I will wander a thousand years.
These words are meant for your ears.
