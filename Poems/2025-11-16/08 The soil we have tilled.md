The soil we have tilled
16 November 2025

Who remembers, through the corridors of dusty time,
the paths that brought us here? And who can say
just how it felt, not knowing anything? If time
heals wounds, it makes us blind to those not synchronized
with our walk through this world. So here's to you,
fair traveller, somewhere on life's journey, in some pain
that I shall never name and cannot comprehend.
I can be friend, and if we dare we might learn
how to make pain end, at the end of the road
or even before, in a house that we build, on the soil
we have tilled.
