Who was left to remember the pain,
the ennui, the cool silence of winter,
when the heat had died down?
Was the dream still attainable? Or does it die now
like so many before? With new clarity I
come again to this story, and pen
what may be its last ending...unless
a new chapter begins, but that chapter
requires a strong coauthor.
