*Cracks Forming
16 November 2025

She watches the stars burn out, and each one
calls with a call she has heard somewhere before,
but she cannot quite place it, cannot place herself
in its orbit. Instead she burns hotter than hope
and ignites with an anger not meant for this world,
from below. She does know it's unhealthy, but cares
not at all for herself or for others. What good has caring
ever done her? Not even the stars remain, and her hope
dwindles faster than any flame. She is lonely, but
this way she cannot be hurt again, cannot mistrust
the wrong person or system. She breathes but she does not live,
she has learned to forgive only sparingly,
not in the way that might heal her, and
not by the light of the moon, which, in concert with sun
holds in place all that matters, not only for her
but for all who live under its spell.
She can tell that she's restless but doesn't know why.
There are cracks forming in her sky.
