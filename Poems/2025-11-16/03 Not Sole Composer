Not Sole Composer
16 November 2025

O sweet muse, shall I ever tire
of your song? You have sung it so long
that my life is in tune,
and my heart beats your rhythms, but alas
the first movement concludes. Shall there be any more?
I am not sole composer. The next notes are yours.
The denouement must come from you.
