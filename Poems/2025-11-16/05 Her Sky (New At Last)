*Her Sky (New At Last)
16 November 2025

She gazes
through the window,
drifts through time
and other forgotten spaces,
wondering who to be.
It's not for me, she says,
but where is home,
where can I rest?
She gazes and grows tired.
Just before she moves to bed,
a star burns out, and others twinkle,
and her sky has changed forever.
Now her sky is new at last.
