*Genius
27 October 2024

The genius wanders through a field still wild
and says "Look at that!", then continues until
time runs out. Later others arrive and build homes there
with schools and with workshops and all the attendant
filth of mankind. Who can say which one knows
the place better? Who can say, because all are but one
or the other and none knows its opposite. But I
take the side of the genius, as one that is closer
to the original spring, the first fountain from whence we arrive
here on earth or wherever we are. Look and see 
how very little the others have done that won't wither
and maybe you also will join in the next expedition
to who knows where and for whatever purpose we dream.
