Less Imposing Principles
27 October 2024

Nature has no purpose,
and least of all is its purpose
ourselves, who cascade between energies
controlled by nothing. This is our belief,
though unspoken, well-founded
on experience we try to forget.
But may be some new hope
could order thought, around less dubious
and less imposing principles.
