We didn't move
27 October 2024

We didn't move,
but the ground beneath us moved.

It was a tremor hardly felt
but soon observed with careful instruments,
then felt. I was aware too soon,
but others feel it now, and so it grows.

We are now somewhere else, but who?
The ground beneath us moves,
but we have never moved.
