A culture in which we can thrive
27 October 2024

It is one thing to know there is chaos,
another to nourish that chaos, and make it grow.
We are not in the mind of God, this much
is true, but for that reason we must *think*
and bring the world under a rule. It will not
rule itself. Our order is good (at least
it can be), but it will not grow itself.
So let us sow and tend and reap
a culture in which we can thrive.
