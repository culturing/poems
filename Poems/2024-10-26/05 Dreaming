Dreaming
26 October 2024

What won't men do for a bit of dignity?
Somewhere a conscience stirs, but not here,
where much power distorts what men feel.
It's an end well begun and done many times before.
There's no hope of averting decline. The hope
is to reproduce and to leave in posterity
some seed that lingers and dwells in the hearts
of those marching into *their* decline, who thus also
must hope for some future, etc. But when does the living begin?
Or was this what life always had been, and shall be,
an imperative, blood-sucking physiology? No. I mean, yes,
but we also live otherwise, and harmonize, one with another,
in some holy music, divine if anything is. There is hope,
pure and natural as body but based on the human experience
of city-building, surely our most striking feature, although we don't
always succeed, we must try evermore to combine. Thus we shall
journey on, into whatever future we dream and, by dreaming, become.
