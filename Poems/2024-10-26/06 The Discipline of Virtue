The Discipline of Virtue
26 October 2024

They have too much freedom, but who can stop them?
Surely no teacher, no sage, would dare impose on their freedom
unless willing to die, given what they are. And yet justice
rings true and cries out from the ether that we
are like mushrooms in a damp, dark cave, ill-adapted
to light and preferring our own noxious fumes. This
is freedom, the freedom to wither and suffer without
any destiny, not knowing better, forgetting that any have ever
been good. We won't hinder each other. We have that much.
But what of the discipline of virtue, acquired
through must repetition?
