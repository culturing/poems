Until I met a woman,  
and her presence strengthened me,  
I did not know that God lives  
not in books, as Calvin claims,  
but in the world of things themselves.  

What mystery lies here  
remains to nourish those who care  
to take the secret that is there  
into a home, and let it steer  
the very lives of things themselves.  

But can we dwell among  
the secret song, the hidden call  
of Earth's long fall for the abyss?  
We have our churches.  
Are they tombs for things themselves?  

I think we have to think this through,  
for God has been a long time dying,  
though he rises from the dead,  
and he is not the only one.  
We know this too of things themselves.
