We have taken lightning captive,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we have made the sky our slave  
on our relentless quest for vengence  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on an Earth we cannot save.  
  
If all is lost, then songs  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot be sung, and yet  
this song goes on, so all  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must still be found somehow.  
  
If we cannot save Earth,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can Earth save us?  
Or is it not a matter  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of saving, but of trust?
