Crossroads
23 November 2023

Where do we go from here, when so much has been said
and so little believed and followed through? Is there empire
within us, or are we provincials at best, better suited to woodsmanship,
hunting for wild game? It is always the same with such peoples
who grow to our size, but the differences make all the difference.
You can tell that I'm joking, but this much is serious:
America stands at a crossroads. Which path shall we take?
