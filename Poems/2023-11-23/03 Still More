Still More
23 November 2023

Under the earth, in a cavern man-made
and yet lacking all purpose, the people gather
to discuss their impending doom. They have no more to say,
but as each goes his way, all discover that all ways
lead here, to this cavern. And thus their ennui.
But a light from above mostly frightens them,
hurting their eyes. For it is not the sun. It's a man
with a flashlight and little respect.
But the man lacks respect just to shine them like that,
both exposing their nakedness and blinding them.
They will not trust him, not after a time and a turn
in his light, so he goes on amusing himself (and to no other purpose),
when suddenly the east wall collapses 
and all of the people observe there the others
who look familiar but who have no annoying flashlight,
and suddenly they wonder whether theirs is really the only cavern
or whether they might find still more.
