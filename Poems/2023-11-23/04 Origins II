Origins II
23 November 2023

In a reverie, I still recall
how before, when approaching to
nature's fire, I saw her, the one
of the dream, yet more real
than all life, and I asked her
how much was required. She said
all and meant it. I knew
that she wasn't for me, but
for others, that this lonely audience
rarely was given, and that, 
having heard, I must speak,
but speak where, and speak how?
In a reverie, there and there only,
where dreams can be tamed and where man
may discover his origins, yearning.
