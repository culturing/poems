Doctor of Words
23 November 2023

There is a madness, a kind of playful
spirit-imp, that seizes me with joy
when comes a time to speak my mind.
I wish you'd listen, but I'll settle for
your nonchalance, compared to those with stones,
which do break bones (though yes, words hurt
more than the many know, and that explains the joy).
But don't forget that wounders must be wounded
'til they learn their place, and that explains my purpose
as the doctor of words, receiving patients constantly,
applying salves, and burning, cutting, trimming as required.
