"It is and is not, and, therefore, is"  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Wallace Stevens, *Page from a Tale*

What have we learned in seventy years?  
What are the lessons of that war
which lately ripped both Europe and Asia  
to pieces, that broke our faith, but left us here?  
If God is dead, what takes his place?  
Or must the place itself change, into  
something open, free for exploration, undefined?  
It is, is not, and therefore is,  
just like ourselves, our lives, and our surrounding aura.  
Who would dare to pin things down again?  
Yet how could beasts like us survive  
without restraint and limitation?  
We have known the pain of man and his machines  
on heaven's throne, have suffered Cromwell's vengeful reign  
for nigh four centuries. This war (the one succeeding,  
recall, the one to end all wars) is but the climax  
of the heavenly interregnum. But what *person*  
dares to sit on such a throne again?  
Are we so human? Human still, despite our deepest cravings,  
loyal subjects to an absent king. Why can't we let God rest in peace?  
We hear the wind disturb the leaves, those covering his grave.  
It's us, the ones you chose to save,  
and then abandoned to the formless blur,  
which is, is not, and therefore is.  
Let's on with it, then, to the new frontier,  
where our longings are answered more plainly  
and with less fear.
