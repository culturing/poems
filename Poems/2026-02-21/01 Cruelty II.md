*Cruelty II
21 February 2026

On second thought, my thoughts turn away,
toward healthier fields. Three times now you have devalued my suit
in the midst of mixed signals. Three times may be enough
to establish a pattern. I have told you I do not find you
unworthy of love, but unbridled cruelty might change that, 
at least in the short term,
even if it wears a mask. It was never the cruelty
that bound me to you. There was something else,
something wonderful, and I still remember it, in fact
I still *see* it, but the picture is complicated now.
I wanted to wish away these slights
as the clumsy confusion of naivete, but maybe
you know *exactly* what you're doing, and maybe
this backhanded cruelty is a form of survival
in a world that won't let you be cruel outright.
Well, I see it at least, but the sight of it
moves my heart out of orbit. There is no decision
to make, I fear the thing has accomplished itself.
I wish you safe passage, as I did from the start,
and I think you have much to accomplish in life
and will accomplish it. I have no regrets.
The sight of you woke in me something
that never will slumber again, the dream of an "us"
that transcends the sum of its parts. I hold onto that dream,
and I hope you will too.
But you are not my responsibility. I will keep writing,
but you may do well to stop reading. It will likely
be bittersweet at best. It has been a pleasure
almost knowing you. Now, to rest.

Is it cruelty, or is it the perception of cruelty?
So much depends on the answer...or is it what I asked for,
quite literally? A love that is not "pure or chaste"?
I had not thought you could make that leap so suddenly
or so completely. Please be careful. Make sure
you understand, and build this new self slowly. Get the foundation
right, and don't throw away the old one until you have something
to take its place. But I hear you. You're willing to leap.
That means a great deal. But you leap, and then subvert.
That means something too.
