The Darkest Possibilities
21 February 2026

It is good to consider the darkest possibilities,
to play devil's advocate, with a question as momentous
as love. He who loves well lives well, and he
who does not does not. Love can make or ruin a man,
if allowed to run its course. But its course
can be interrupted, and should be, when needed.
