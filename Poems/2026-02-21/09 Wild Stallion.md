*Wild Stallion
21 February 2026

The wild stallion in my heart
is chomping at the bit, but the charioteer
has the reins. I am feeling a bit wild...
wild enough to do something drastic
and life-changing, like making love over and over.
But the charioteer says: there are greener pastures
over yonder. Take her there.
