Power brings its many blessings,  
Though it comes by other names.  
This is what we find by singing.  
  
Days were young and love did sting us.  
All young people feel the same.  
They mix themselves with power’s blessings.  
  
Some find laurels, others cling  
To lovely children's games.  
Thus they lose themselves in singing,  
  
Thus they fall before the morning,  
Thus they are to blame.  
But power brings them such mixed blessings,
  
Power puts off dark of dying,  
Power’s light must wane.  
Therefore, find thyself in singing,  
  
Make thine own some other name,  
And know I feel the same,  
Because this power mixes life with blessings.  
This is what we find by singing.
