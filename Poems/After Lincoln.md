### After Lincoln

Alas, there came more wars, \
at least as brutal, \
oddly spirited,

And Lincoln, growing old, \
was placed on coins, \
enshrined in brooding stone \
for all to see and know.

And speakers came \
and went, the tanks \
went on parade, \
and progress dreams \
were sung, and listen, listen, \
you there, listen, \
but don’t listen for too long,

because too many have got stuck there \
and we may have got it wrong.

—

Wrong and wrong and wrong. \
Must we go back to 1619?

Cease your wailing, History! \
That brutal, trifling song!

—

If back we go, then back, \
but all the way, \
past slaves and ships \
to Milton, Christ, and Socrates, \
as Lincoln surely knew.

And History, sweet Dame, \
it‘s true, we cannot quarrel long,

But oh, your song, your song! \
it will need rearranging before long.
