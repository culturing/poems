Where You Are Stepping
11 August 2024

Power attracts the power-hungry, who,
always unfriendly (despite good appearances),
see other humans as prey, and devour
those too close to flee or too innocent to see
what man is. But take heart, there is room
in the emptier places, where trees are permitted
to grow as they will, as are men. Know this then,
that your place may not be by the glowing lights,
but in soil, time's detritus, the life or your elders
transformed into nourishment for you. Tread lightly.
You never know where you are stepping.
