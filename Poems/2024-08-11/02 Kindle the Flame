Kindle the Flame
11 August 2024

Kindle the flame, turn the hearthstones,
and tell yourself why you have come.
A reminder to always believe,
even when there is no ground beneath you.
That flame flickers bravely in all darkness,
which ignites an embryo's life,
and drives it on. It's no small wonder
that we're here, or how we're here.
But then from time to time the hearth
grows cool, as part of the cycle, and our duty
is to tend it with all care. It's there now,
bhikkhu, and your path goes in a circle,
out into the dark and cold to bring flame there
and then back here to tend your own flame.
You must be aware. It's ancient,
inexhaustible, and rare. I thus commend you
to the present, if you dare.
