The Fulcrum of Time
11 August 2024

In the face of death, who stands?
Buddha says an unwounded hand
may handle poison, but I say life
lives to wound, and who is not wounded?
But grant that the virtuous bear it better
than those sick with desire, death still
comes reaping through time to this moment,
the hour of decision, where all things
can change and where death also
reminds us of spring and new birth
on the fulcrum of time at the pivot point 
of our lives.
