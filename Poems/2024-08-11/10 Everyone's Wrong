Everyone's Wrong
11 August 2024

Everyone's wrong about everything,
that's all, nothing more serious than that,
and yet all flickers bravely while perishing,
and few ever notice. Oh well, we are here,
are we not, so let's party, and not dwell
on substance or other mirages,
those lonely chimeras that keep thinkers up
and keep all others down...no, let's none of that.
Rather let's trace our way back to the stars,
where the gods always are, though we know
how they change, as *we*, always the same,
are the true pole on which it all turns...

Some may say it's absurd, and I hear them,
but how is a man to stay sane
in a tribe come mad?
