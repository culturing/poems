*She's There
11 August 2024

I cannot find her, Sophia, the maiden
of stars, in the heavens, nor here
between men, but instead I discover her
under the surfaces, deep in the veins,
through the cracks of mankind in the chasm
of time, where all life begins, under
ideas, below even words. She is singing,
and I cannot find her, but I know she's there.
