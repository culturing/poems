Good Eyes
26 April 2023

I was born sighted in a tribe of the blind,
who, never seeing, are never aware that there
are things to be seen. I was born
nonetheless, and pay homage for that,
if for little that followed. With my eyes
I've seen man betray man, finding pleasure
in cruelty, time after time, but no wonder,
since wonderful things must be seen.
Would you like me to help with your unbelief?
