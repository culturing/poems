Stop the Bombing
26 April 2023

Amazing isn't it, how easily one now
can say what once got one killed.
But if one or if many rebel, one
must ask, to what purpose? If done
as a duty and not mere licentiousness,
surely some pause is demanded, or even
required. So stop the bombing, so
Christ is risen, and so the new faith,
when it comes.
