Something About Plato
26 April 2023

There's just something about Plato
that led to his preservation. Was it
the lofty ideals, or was it simply
his extra gear, the secret room of the mind
that would open to him, and him alone?
If the latter, we do well to praise him
but not to emulate him.

Only through turmoil
does genius bear fruit. Many could grow
but don't, because peace does not call out for
change, only troubles bring change,
only change summons genius, but genius
endures. We do well to take care
before summoning genius. We may not like
what it says.
