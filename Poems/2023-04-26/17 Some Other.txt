*Some Other
26 April 2023

Upon the way backward
to what Plato meant
(it's for you, bon esprit, all for you)
in this desert I stand
with no road and no path and no map
and where even the sky is blank
and I wonder what anything means
in this way, with myself to blame
or to praise for the barren expanse,
but not satisfied owning it,
searching instead for some other
whose cause is as good as my own.
