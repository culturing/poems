*The Thin Veil
26 April 2023

How many graves will it take before
somebody notices? Aye, you will say
some have noticed before, but few feel
what the dying must feel. Let me tell you,
it is not less hostile than life, nor
more cold than compassionless love.
You will answer, but I cannot hear,
being rapt by the shimmering veil,
the thin veil that divides men from murder
and rustles against drums of war.
