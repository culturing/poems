*The Way of the Night
26 April 2023

Like no one's business, I entered
the place of the skull, on a mission
to root out those staining the temple.
'Twas a dark and stormy time in my mind,
but all indications say all is fine.
After some deliberation, prepared
for denial and banishment, into
the tomb I crept, and was swept
by a wind like no other, from beyond,
toward death, but then also toward
something outside of death, to some
origin speaking through dreams. I
believe it was something like truth,
but not nature, for nature cares little
for truth, or for us. It was empty,
but this was alluring, a void that could
drain the false fullness of things,
so I leapt, and some part of me
left me for ever, to wander the shores
of Elysium, or else to die
but to die in a way more refined,
with more grace, with aplomb,
in the way of the night.
