At Eleusis
26 April 2023

Follow these steps, if you dare
descend here unaware, and be made known
before a *demos* that is known. First wander
here, then there, but watch! for grasping
fingers in the dark. They cannot harm you
more than life can harm you. Step here
through this opening, join these others, soon
you'll know. Behold! the goddess flies!
She rises from the tomb! It is Demeter,
goddess of the corn. Consider how the corn,
with many seeds, may grow, when this plant 
sinks below. There is no other way.
Consider well, and be thus nourished,
threefold blessed by life, by birth,
and by their cousin death.
