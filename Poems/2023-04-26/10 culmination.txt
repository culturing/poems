You would think that by now
we'd be perfect, we've striven
so hard all these years
that no pain could emerge
which we could not destroy,
that with gods on Olympus
surrounded by heroes and victors
of various wars and games
we would celebrate, nectar
in one hand, machines in the other,
but why is this always just out of reach?
