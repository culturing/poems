The Scientist
26 April 2023

The scientist pauses, haunched
like a cat of the mind, poised
for pouncing, emboldened by Truth
which has turned out to be a simple case
of precision in measurement. He is
ready for mysteries to explain themselves
clearly, distinctly, without hesitation.
But after the clock strikes five,
as he hangs up his lab coat,
a question arises which he 
is unable to answer: 
what are we to measure?
and how shall we choose?
