*They May Be Right
26 April 2023

I was here before, but did not know it.
Now I know, but that has not made me any wiser.
See the lovers entwined on the beach before dawn.
Unassuming teachers, little did they know that I saw.
But rising beyond them the sea was a formless expanse.
The light broke through the horizon and cracked the surface.
I could not remember who I was waiting to meet.
It was like every dawn in uniqueness, though still being dawn.
As the lovers shuffled I saw ever clearer day coming.
It was and was not meant for them, nor for me.
The shadows grew longer but this time that just felt okay.
The lovers departed before the full sun was in sight.
I have never doubted the feeling that they may be right.
