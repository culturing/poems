The Question of Democracy
26 April 2023

The People are not worthy of their servants
when those servants serve with honor, when
"most people" rule the hearts of men, when
servitude is servile and not grand. The People
groan at honor, moan for pleasure, lack the common ground
which makes men noble, who are products of that ground
and of no other. Thus those fight for what produced them
while the People (hear me!) claw and scratch the same.

But now what of it? Shall we have another war, or is it simply
undecidable, this question of democracy? I say no war
can answer what remains so fundamental. But why
only *Greeks* and their inheritors have wrestled with this question
is more likely to bear fruit, and bear it soon.
