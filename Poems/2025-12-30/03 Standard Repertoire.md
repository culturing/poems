Standard Repertoire?
30 December 2025

What did you mean by extracting from a song
of the deepest devotion, the part of that song
that could be taken as a "no" to love if one listens closely?
Was devotion the point or its subversion, or maybe
a tightrope between the two? You are clever,
too clever not to notice what you've done.
Or is it a question of categories, which role suits you
and which suits me? I don't know myself. But
I'd like to find out, through your eyes perhaps,
or at least through your song. But your song is a riddle
with puzzling alternatives. Are *you* that riddle?
You will have to explain. Or maybe
it's just standard repertoire.
