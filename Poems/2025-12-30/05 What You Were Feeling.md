*What You Were Feeling
30 December 2025

I see your composure slip (a rare thing for you)
and some real emotion emerge, as you stare straight into the camera.
It is very moving if it means what I think it means.
And you put this work front and center as if for emphasis.
Surely another take would have cleaned up the slips
had you had your résumé in mind. But I like it this way.
It has served its purpose. I'd like to know what you were feeling.
