Lost Voice
30 December 2025

I'm confused. Does that suit you, or was it an accident?
For one who's not falling in love, you sure
make a good impression. But maybe these feelings
are fuel for your art, nothing more. I'm not sure.
I'll keep watching, because I enjoy the show,
but I cannot become too attached this way.
It's not the best way, if you ask me, but somehow
my voice has been lost somewhere, left to echo
across the cavernous spanse of time, so I guess I'll just
listen, and sing my own songs in the void.
