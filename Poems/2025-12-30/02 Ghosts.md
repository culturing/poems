Ghosts
30 December 2025

Why do I linger in this garden, where only ghosts
return my favor, and keep me company from a distance
rather than walking here beside me? Do these ghosts
portend some future when all things will be revealed,
or are the ghosts the show and all I can expect?
I'll linger for a little while (these ghosts are rather charming,
and I am quite fond of cemeteries) but only
until fancy wanes or things become more clear.
