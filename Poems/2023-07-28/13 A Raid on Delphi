*A Raid on Delphi
28 July 2023

We were the last to arrive, and by then
it had all been taken -- the gold, the weapons,
the scolls -- but how little we knew, thinking
we with our plans could best Fate. Call it
Hubris, whatever it was, but don't tell us
to kneel before gods who spoke Greek, even here.
We are here to rob temples whose keepers
have long since passed out of Memory,
brought by temptation or will to power,
to seek restitution for years of disgrace,
but not here. Even here there are ghosts,
where the skeletons slumber for ages,
where rough beasts, awaiting the turn of the wheel,
shriek to fever at mankind's injustice
and roll out new images and gods.
