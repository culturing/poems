This Way Forever
28 July 2023

I have been trying toaster ovens,
and all of them make me sick.
It's a wonder how far we have come.
The design is immaculate, the interface delightful,
the fumes so toxic I could die.
I have been testing toaster ovens
just to find out what I've known all along,
that the smiles of the marketers lie,
that we live at the mercy of industry
(never one known for its mercy).
I've been testing ovens like propositions, 
but this simply can't be refuted:
I dislike machines and their toxins,
and will not accept 
that we have to live this way forever.
