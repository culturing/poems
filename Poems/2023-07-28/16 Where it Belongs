Where it Belongs
28 July 2023

I am coming to the point,
this time for certain. With you
standing there, I had simply forgotten
society, lost in your ocean of words,
not yet sure, but approaching it,
waiting for final discovery. True,
you were not one to wait in the past
nor the present, but always going
just one step further, then another.
I never could figure out who you were,
but the message came in loud and clear:
there's a baby asleep in the road,
and somebody has got to remind it
of where it belongs.
