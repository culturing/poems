Arrival
28 July 2023

I have been on a journey towards myself,
but how shall I ever arrive (who arrives?)

Like America, I am a mixed breed,
but that is not to say I am formless.

We are all of us formed by each other,
including the others both past and future.

I have been on a journey towards myself,
but arriving is never that simple.

The others have been on a journey too,
towards me and away from me.

I must care for them, since we have formed each other,
and hope they will care for me too.

This is the one who arrives.
