*To Even Have a Dream
28 July 2023

What a crazy *swirl* life is,
when stress subsides, when freedom
breathes again. It is like liberty
was never taken captive by an empire,
or like spirit never had to stand in line.
But we can't live here, not like this,
not as we are, for we are more than dreams,
we mammals, who need sustenance to dream.
