Those Reformers,  
in order to flee from imperium,  
fell for an earlier vice:  

That phalanx of mind  
wherein each must stay sturdy or die.  

But our world is better  
equipped for peace.  

Though the devil in man  
never sleeps.  

Oi! must I now know my neighbor?  
And how can I, knowing him, sleep?  

But were he restrained  
by imperium, phalanx, or rights,  
love could be,  
but alas, he is free.  

Therefore,  
what will he make of me?
