All Man Has Been
12 January 2024

The Romans did a number on Europe,
and left it unable to roam free.
It's easy to see the obedience,
deep and habitual, challenged by Hegel
but then in the end even he was absorbed,
and the structure remains, bearing even the dead weight
of Derrida. Here in America, we broke free
early, but struggle to find the new balance,
so staggering into the graveyard, we stumble
upon ancient history, carved in stone,
inviting observers to ponder 
all man has been or can be.
