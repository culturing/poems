I speak for the people
12 January 2024

I speak for the people when saying to the Christians
that you do not get to tell us how to love. We'll do fine
on our own, but we must find some limits somehow.
Until then, we must journey, with no holy books,
guide ourselves, and pray old gods don't rise for their vengeance.
