It may also help you
12 January 2024

I come to ask you at this lonely hour
to believe less and hope less, and you, being wise,
will discern that to do so will weaken you. Yet,
I ask anyway, to teach you a new kind of strength,
not of castles impregnable but rather of men in pitched battle,
where throw or be thrown is the rule. You will surely
encounter in life many men who know well this arena
and they may hurl you into it unaware. So let's practice
and spar for awhile. It has helped me.
It may also help you.
