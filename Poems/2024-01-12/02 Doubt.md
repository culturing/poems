Doubt
12 January 2024

I have lived with this ache in my side
for so long it is hard to imagine
not having it. Yet, I could thrive, it is true,
under doctor's care..."studies show..."
but they have never studied *me*,
the particular man, he who sleeps in each bed,
who lives under the aegis of Science
but is not known by it...prithee tell me
what *care* is experimentation, the lab-man
set loose on his subject for fun and profit?
I do not know why I thus mock it,
lest others think that I do know,
but in fact, I doubt, as is now the fashion,
but doubt that this doubt could reach certainty,
clarity, truth, or obedience, all of which go 
into care. Does my doctor doubt? For if so,
he will not be must trusted. If not,
he shall not follow science.
I go now to bed, to the sweeter rest,
free from doubt and its faithful unfaithfulness,
stewards of Science, but with this last hope,
that some fruit of their labor may comfort me still
even so.
