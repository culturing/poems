Life Over Victory
12 January 2024

I see them, streaming in numbers beyond compare,
having been asked to give up even the possibility of violence,
and having refused. Is their day coming? Not yet, but it comes
as it always comes, to political animals like us. Will today
be the day the walls fall, towers breached, with the crown
tossed up for grabs? It cannot be postponed forever.
May the winners choose mercy and the losers choose life over victory.
