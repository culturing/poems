Calypso
12 December 2025

Years ago, I stopped off on Calypso's shores
and asked her: what is love? She would not answer
though she took delight in hearing me ask again and again.
For three long years I asked, and learned the hard way
what love is not. And yet I think that she was moved somehow.
I saw her cry real tears. I heard she moved away
and became a normal woman.
