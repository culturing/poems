Come and See
12 December 2025

Will we walk together, once the dust has settled,
when the heat has been sliced clearly, and all of its mirages
fade away? I know, yes, not today, but this
does not feel far away. I'd like to hear you
laugh, perhaps at me, and my silly poetry. But don't you think
you'd like to come and see?
