Out came a cry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from beneath the great Nothing,
but no one was there to believe it.

An oomph went woomph,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the meaning went missing,
and no one was there to retrieve it.

And day was like sand,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the moon went away,
and nobody was there to be free with.
