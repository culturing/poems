A New Way
29 October 2023

Can we handle another Kennedy, or will he
just die like the others, unable to bring to fruition
the will of the people? And what do the people will?
The fiction of peace "for all time" is disturbing
for those who think time is indomitable, yet
this is no worse than all Catholic thought.
But the question of truth against power lives on,
and continues to draw cheering crowds. Give us Liberty, then,
or death, but when you will oppress us,
if you find a new way, we'll obey.
