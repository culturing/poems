*Discard Them Already
29 October 2023

Who would have thought such a thing had a spirit,
or that it would govern us poorly, with iron grip?
Maybe Hegel or Marx, but to us with our battle fatigue
at its climax, their words feel so hollow and trite,
as with all of our might we endure in a race
suited more to machines than to rats...and what *is* man,
after all? Does he think, even so? And by thinking, produce
ever new ways of doing, procedure after procedure after procedure,
as new as the rising sun? The machines have not taken this much.
They are just one iteration of the latest procedure, so quickly
outdated we might as well discard them already.
