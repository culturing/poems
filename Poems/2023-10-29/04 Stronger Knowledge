Stronger Knowledge
29 October 2023

From Kant we have taken the fruit
of the knowledge of self and other,
and never again shall we live within 
Christendom, banished instead to the East,
where they've known for all time
that our knowledge evolves over time, though
they've rarely fretted over the details.
Armed with our *much stronger* knowledge,
we'll march into capitals, ready to conquer
all change, but it's not been the same
since God died. We must ask ourselves
*why* we must fight for ideas, when fighting
hurts bodies (including our own), for philosophers
rarely make excellent role models. Neither do saints.
Shall we imitate businessmen? Who else remains
in a nonsacral culture, devoted to ego?
It's only opponent, the Christians, pray on with eyes closed
though the dome of the church falls around them.
