    <blockquote>I desire you would Remember the Ladies, and be more generous and favourable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the Husbands. Remember all Men would be tyrants if they could.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>We are obliged to go fair, and softly, and in Practice you know We are the subjects. We have only the Name of Masters, and rather than give up this, which would completely subject Us to the Despotism of the Petticoat, I hope General Washington, and all our brave Heroes would fight.</blockquote>

I would find an Abigail, with wit enough
to make me doubt myself, and love enough
to do so only when required, in jest, perhaps,
but also as a nudge in the right direction.
The provocations of a spirited woman, wise and pointed...
can a man find a greater blessing? But of course
I shall retain my lofty airs, returning fire
against the despotism of the petticoat,
the true laws of nature and nature's society,
the queen in the hearts of all men.
