Strong Enough Now
16 January 2026

A strange choice, a need to step back
comes over me, with all the imperative power
of dreams. What is happening? I will not know
for some time, but I follow the advice
of my instincts, and pull the rug so to speak,
but gently, reminding of possibilities.
My guidance could be like a crutch,
which you must escape to be free. We've prepared for that.
You can do this. You can stand on your own feet.
Your legs are strong enough now.
