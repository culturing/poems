A New Here
16 January 2026

What a strange mystery, silence after eruptions of passion...
I could blame the weather, but whether or not we control it,
I'm here now, but somewhere not quite like before, a new here,
a new place where we maybe could meet not as minds
but as bodies and humans as well. I can tell you are frightened,
and maybe this instinct responds to some signal from you saying
"slow down." I'll slow, but I want you to know I'm not giving up,
not even close.
