*Much More Down Below
16 January 2026

When I step back and survey the journey we've taken
(for surely it has been your journey as well) I'm amazed
and I feel my trepidation wane...for somehow we seem to have struck a vein
of passion buried deep in our collective soul (for surely we share the same soul).
That vein has erupted, unleashing its pent up pressure, releasing its gases
and filling the air with the perfume of love. I now
must examine these fumes and this rupture. What started
as a walk in the park has revealed much more down below.
