*Hors D'Oeuvres
16 January 2026

I must wean you off of these poems to make way
for solid food that could nourish you. This has been
a taste, an hors d'oeuvre, and the meal is prepared,
but you must know whether you choose to partake. Your attendance
is requested with alacrity and verve, but the choice is yours,
and I gather you may not be feeling well, so if you choose
to retire to your room, it will be understood, not resented.
But when these fine foods are presented, you may find
your appetite grows and your body strengthens, more so
than from any hors d'oeuvre, and you may feel your hunger
alive at last. You may even come back for more.
