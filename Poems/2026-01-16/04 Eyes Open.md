*Eyes Open
16 January 2026

I have seen you in the midnight hour
invade my dreams, then nestle into place
among the other ghosts that soothe me while I sleep.
It is a welcome thing (you are), but it is not enough.
We must be friends as well, and we must fight,
and we must disagree, because we live on earth.
But I can see you, even now, beneath my eyelids,
and I wish to see you even with eyes open.
