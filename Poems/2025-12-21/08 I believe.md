I believe
21 December 2025

I believe it now, though it took a long time.
It took a long time because love is a threat
to my peace of mind, and to yours. My defenses
have learned to be cautious, but this time I think
the defense is unnecessary. Let us now prove it.
My mind for the first time agrees.
I do not merely wish. I *believe*.
