Trust and Open Dialogue
21 December 2025

But you may leave me no choice. Love is not all,
I also must know that I can come to you for clarity
and receive it, not a mystery. A feeling cannot carry
all the weight of mundane, everyday friction,
without recurring interventions. We must *make* love endure,
not by burning hotter, but by putting it in a vessel
that can hold it, then tending the flame. Our flame
gets hotter by the minute, and soon it will hurt us
if we don't capture it and give it what it needs:
a place to burn, a strong container, made with trust
and open dialogue.
