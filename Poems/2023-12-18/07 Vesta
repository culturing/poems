*Vesta
18 December 2023

Vesta, guardian of eternal fire, what life
hath thou in a time like this? Lord Vulcan
rules o'er all, and we live by *his* flame,
so what of yours? If winter comes, so be it,
for as sure as we are flesh, we bathe
in steel, and watch the lathe, the wheel
coax mechanism into ghastly life. But Vesta,
thou doth call out still within the soul
to all those longing to be whole. Can hope arrive?
Can hope come here, into this desecrated chamber
of the Vestal orgy, long since over, haunted still by ghosts?
They are our hosts, and like good guests we must
not leave here empty-handed. We must take an icon
to be cherished, and to grow into the newest love,
the newest hope. That is within our scope.
But Vesta, knowst thou where the balm resides,
which once soothed aching eyes and aching souls?
