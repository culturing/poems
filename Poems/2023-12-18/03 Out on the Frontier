Out on the Frontier
18 December 2023

In the morning, one hardly
sees clearly, but lately I've noticed
the goal remains not to succeed
but to fail in the same way
as everyone else. In those cases
where failure is common, success becomes
dangerous -- therefore, let's fail,
as our parents before us have failed,
and not dare to succeed like those
brazen and ostracized weirdos
out on the frontier.
