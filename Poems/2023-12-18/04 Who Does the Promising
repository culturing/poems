Who Does the Promising?
18 December 2023

When will the promises of science
come true? Or are they, like most promises,
intended to deceive? I see over the horizon
a world in which men live by deeds
and not promises -- one where the future
is present in embryo, really there and perceived,
but not promised, for who does the promising,
and why should we trust them instead of ourselves?
