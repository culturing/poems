*Into the Sea
18 December 2023

Into the sea, the Mediterranean Sea,
swim with me, past commander and legionary,
past Athens, all temples of Zeus,
and Jerusalem too; swim past Crete
and the legends of Homer, and rest
on the sea's cold floor. Here find solace,
long sought by all moderns, and here find
the end of all law and obedience,
chthonic remonstrances, pulsing through time
and the hearts of all men, underneath
all ideals, in the bosom of earth,
in the womb of all worlds. Under here,
to the core, thirst no more, for these waters
will satisfy, unlike those others
that rain from the sky. But thus nourished,
return and build shelters for you, and for others,
to live in as much peace as possible.
