Touch
18 December 2023

Let us walk, if you will, through the avenues
of time, to the clarity of iron, a firmness
once realized and never forgotten. Its age
lives within us, with all ages past, in a soup
we call history, in a place we call home.
If we walk, we shall see that all men
are the same, whether born now or later,
that Progress is groundless, it swims in the aether.
Machines have not changed what we are, nor has money,
nor charity, law, or iron. The σπέρμα remains what it was,
is now, and ever shall be, implanted by Vesta, a yearning
for fullness, which all mammals know, though we may
know it best. How has this been forgotten?
How have we illustrious mammals
lost *touch* with those things that define us?
