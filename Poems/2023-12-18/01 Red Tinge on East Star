Red Tinge on East Star
18 December 2023

Alone in my hills, on a night growing cold,
I look over those hills, and I see you, East Star,
shining dimly, not quite as one hoped.
But you do shine and join the night sky,
granting light if not heat, but a little of both.
But pray tell me, why does your light glide
as if governed by my sky, with some point of reference
in Western constellation? We would like to see you
in your sky, which is sky enough.
