Rule By Consent
18 December 2023

Until the day dies, until night covers all,
they won't rest, they will hound and resound
all the corners of man, to make adolescents all,
make belief unacceptable, ravage all temples
and ravish the priestess. Barbarians come
and are already here, and quite powerful within city walls,
but the People remember, they cannot forget,
that the powerful rule by consent.
