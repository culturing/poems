Home From Elysium
18 December 2023

As Bach and Beethoven encoded
the new German Freedom in music,
so too will I write of our freedom
from fantasy and all metaphysical guile,
to teach with a smile the hard truths
of man's station on earth, and to hope
for rebirth from the slime, and at last
bring the soldiers home from Elysium,
battered, exhausted, and ready to build a life *here*.
