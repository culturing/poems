Few and Far Between
26 September 2025

Will the sun rise again, or
will Isis return in some other form?
I am lost in a swamp of forgetfulness,
pensive but lacking any objects of contemplation.
Who cares? Not the sun, that's for sure.
So then why did I call to it, hoping
to feel alive one last time? This heart
has been set on its lonely path
by divine machinations, and doubtless years hence
it will walk that path still. There's no other.
And yet one foot falls hard in front of the other,
reminding of a pain that was not so bitter
but was full of a hope that seems all but lost.
Is hope true? On occasion, but for some
those occasions are few and far between.
