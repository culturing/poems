The Hard Rock of Reality
26 September 2025

With eagle's eyes, I gaze at shapes
and forms fit for disguise, the soothing illusions
that give us peace and rest...it is no wonder
we build homes to keep the world out, and no wonder
that the world is always creeping in. But hey,
at least we're sometimes happy. That is more
than some achieve, out there on the hard rock
of reality, where the sun burns and the winds parch
and man is a piteous Poor Tom.
