Beatrice and Penelope
26 September 2025

Whence comes this fascination, holy wonder,
holy desire? Is it Beatrice, who, in human form
mocked Dante for his love, and yet in spirit form
inspired his rise to heaven? Who controls this?
It controls us. Lord, please grant me a Penelope
that I might wander purposefully
and not be snared by Circe or her sirens.
