Bones on the Inside
26 September 2025

Walk with me near this carapace,
this hard shell briefly discarded. Must I
wear it again to survive here, or have I
grown stronger, enough to stand naked
and say what I have to say? I have
so much to say to so many that I must
take care not to damage them, but
they can no longer damage me.
So let's walk with our bones on the inside.
