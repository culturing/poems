*Scheduled Procreation
26 September 2025

Into the crypts again, down under
all life, where the embryos nestle
awaiting fertilization...I feel their terror,
unsure what to be or become, lacking
everything. What rude muscle comes
to awaken sleeping powers, divide the world
into us and them, and enhance life
with new life? It will be
what must be, as the wheel turns
to the scheduled procreation.

But will it be happy?
Who knows?
That is not even part of the question.
