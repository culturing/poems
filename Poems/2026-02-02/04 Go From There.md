*Go From There
02 February 2026

What more is there to say?
I have bared my heart here, in front of you
and many witnesses (all of posterity)...
One last reassurance: I can keep my hands to myself
for as long as needed, and it may be needed.
For I may burst at the seams with desire
and yet conclude that it's better to wait
for complete fulfillment.
This seems like a likely course. But we can start now
to fulfill what I take to be mutual desire.

If you're ready, then meet me
at the site of the night of the pigtails.
We'll sit together and go from there.
