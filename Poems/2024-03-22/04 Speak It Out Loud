*Speak It Out Loud
22 March 2024

Let it be remembered
that the stasis grew impenetrable,
that each side fought to kill
but weakened slowly, that the dawn
came ever closer but was not known,
that mankind in the twenty-first century
stayed unsure, despite its patina of knowledge,
and lest we be informed, we also grow
toward that dawn, because time moves us
out of Progress, into homes manmade and durable.

The living commences then with a story
about how we got here, through chaos and also
executive action, which foists upon common people
feelings and thoughts known to dazzle great minds.
Bamboozled thus, all wander aimlessly, doubting
that aims could exist or that any who champion them
have any motive but domination. If only they knew
about history, like that it exists, or that others have lived
other ways and still prospered, sometimes more than we.
But such things cannot be under this dark dominion,
the spectre of progress asleep at the wheel, like the God
that it claims to displace...

This disgrace is expiring, but what takes its place
it's not my place to say. Let the ones who will follow
decide what to call it. I only speak now, but I speak it out loud.
