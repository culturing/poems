Upon the Dawn
22 March 2024

Something now is seeming, and the stars
must shift awry, thus making way for some
messiah in the hay. It will take years,
but even these old fulsome ears may
hear it cry, before time comes to drop
the curtain on it too. So many things
have been and so few still remain,
but here we are, and we must try.
So turn your telescopes, and swivel your receivers,
for the messengers will ride upon the dawn.
