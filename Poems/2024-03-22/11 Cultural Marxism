Cultural Marxism
22 March 2024

Call it what you will, but I
think "dialectics" will do, if understood
to mean what Hegel dreamed, the absolute
that flutters free. Of course we thinkers
know what he means, but some of us doubt
universals. Cannot some things be
believed, just because they have withstood
time's testing? Why must we apply
our own testing, in all times and places?

Regardless Marx too cared for ideas
more than he admitted, he just sought
to change them by changing material
conditions. His Doctors of History
have failed time and time again.
But "cultural dialectical materialism"
is just dialectics. The other two cancel.
The question remains when and where
to question, and how. Maybe Hegel
has worn out his welcome. Maybe Plato
knows best after all.
