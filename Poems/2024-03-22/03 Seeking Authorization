Seeking Authorization
22 March 2024

None of these thoughts have been authorized
by relevant authorities, but, nonentheless true, I
shall speak them, for truth is the common property
of a people, and a people is made up of persons who
(believe it or not) sometimes think their own thoughts.
Have you heard this before? Am I overreacting?
Then why are you here with your pitchforks?
