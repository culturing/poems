“Romance Revisited,” revisited
14 November 2018

I saw you there
atop the stair,
it’s true,

And you were me
and I was you,

And ocean blue
bore love away.

It chastened him right through.

Alas! they say
it is no use to sing,

But I’ll take wing, for lo! 
Minerva’s owl has perched
upon a husk, a lifeless stump,

and there will be no going on
without new songs from flesh and blood.
