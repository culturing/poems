Less perfect than it seemed
01 August 2025

Even unrequited love
can change a man, awaken
sleeping powers of the soul, inspire
courage. So take heart, and listen
from the start to every call.
Don't be afraid to fall.
But do not fall too fast,
for as things pass, this too shall pass,
and what remains will be less perfect than it seemed.
