Farewell, Isis
01 August 2025

Evening comes, and day wanes.
What a glorious dream! What a hope!
Then no more. Are you sure
you can make things last? Are you sure?
I have been to the house of the dead.
I have waited and moaned
with the other lost souls,
but when Isis appears, I say:
staying is better. What folly.
And yet it is better to know,
I suppose, than to wonder,
but life without wonder is death,
and no hope can awaken all those
who refuse. Farewell, Isis.
Return to the world of the living
and look for your happiness there.
