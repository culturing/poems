Afterthought on the Romantics
21 September 2022

They strove to bring the dark into the light.
What evident folly, yet an understandable urge
to *see* the dark, there, always. It *is* there,
but it cannot be seen. It is the absence of sight,
a lack of presence. To make *this* present
is to hollow what remains. Instead, we now learn
how to build, with subtle lighting, some cool nave
of stone, where light and shadow interplay.
This way we can keep both, and keep them well.
