Wandering, questioning,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;as before Dawn,  
I am *sure* of this much:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;that we hold our beliefs  
far too tightly.  

--

I think back,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;I think back,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think back,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;but hear only more riveting.  

Rosie, poor Rosie,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;no place for a woman here.

What is the *other* beginning,  
the one without steel-plated Mind,  
where things grow as we all know they do?  

In the mountains,  
I hear baby truths being born.  

--

Begin *here*. Nowhere else.  
This is where you were born and will die.

A rowdy patron observes: "You had to be there!"  
I think this is rather apt, and tell him so,  
but what more could I tell him?  
He knows what it is to know.
