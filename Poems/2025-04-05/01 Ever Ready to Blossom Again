*Ever Ready to Blossom Again
05 April 2025

Let's break open the shell of the past
and invite the discomfort of knowing. This way
is the way of the hero, demanding courage.
You are that hero, and I...I am only your guide,
here reminding you of quests left undone and treasures forgotten
out there on the cold plains of Lethe. So many
have come and gone, so many...but you are here now
to remember, and put back together what once,
or a few times, made like more bearable,
here where the shores of the past meet the future's ocean,
where all life occurs, and where, if you listen,
an ancient god stirs, ever ready to blossom again.
