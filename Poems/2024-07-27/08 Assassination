Assassination
27 July 2024

In those moments when everything changes,
by bullets or otherwise, know this:
that time carries on, and that we
are its ministers, solitary here
despite chaos, despite bloody pain,
though this is not enough to assuage
the unrest. What becomes of a people
shorn thus from itself by an act
of the most basic barbarism?
Some will say yes, others no,
but all must feel profoundly
the change that has come, and
the change that was barely averted.
In times like this, weep, but then
rise to your feet and speak loudly
that *weakness* inspires all bloodthirsty deeds,
for the strong have no need of them,
having instead the support of the people.
This weakness remains the great animus,
cause of all fear between men,
though this time it has been unsuccessful.
In time we will see what this means.
