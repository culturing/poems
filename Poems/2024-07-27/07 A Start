A Start
27 July 2024

Let this be a start, and let it
answer for the pain of years neglected
by a faith alleged to free us from all time.
Is God still there when you are alone?
Or does he come in groups of three,
as legend has it? Answer me this
and I will leave you to yourself, and I will leave you
as you were and are and shall be.
