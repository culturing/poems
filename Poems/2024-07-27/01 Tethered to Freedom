Tethered to Freedom
27 July 2024

How do I cope with it, spent
and yet grasping for more, like a fish
out of water...what water can hold me
and not let me go? Or am I not
a creature of water at all? There are
things that one sees to believe, but
they are least important. The instincts
know better, and one of these yearns
for community. We are too free,
so it seems, each as free as the rest,
to fit in. If belonging were not in
our hearts, who would want to be free?
I see armies of others
refusing our freedom, insisting on some
new coherence (their own),
and yet we are here tethered
to freedom, for better or worse.
