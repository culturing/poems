Surely We Know Best
27 July 2024

It is a miracle each time, but,
none the wiser, we plod on,
transforming Nature's bounty,
making hers our own. What *is* life?
Just the animating principle, just
the motive force, the cause of growth,
just *everything that matters*? But
no matter, surely we know best.
Let's kill it all.
