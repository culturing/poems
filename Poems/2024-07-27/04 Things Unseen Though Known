*Things Unseen Though Known
27 July 2024

In the beginning, one finds God
alone, on an empty beach, the waves
descending and ascending, like before
but never the same, slight modifications
adding up an ocean of change.
It makes much difference whether we
are there as well, or if we dwell
*within* the waves, well, then no use
in trying. But the moon and sun
and other stars reveal themselves to those
with open eyes, as other causes,
to the point that one was many,
and that God reflects the lights of all
as in a mirror darkly, surely a mirage,
as sure as man can be, yet free
to twinkle like a passing ghost
within our minds and memories,
of times long gone and things unseen
though known.
