The Wind and My Place in It
27 July 2024

Can anyone remember the point of it all,
or have we lost it, falling
into some oblivion forevermore?
I am not one to remain
where I am not wanted,
and so talk of substance or soul
bears no weight. But I am among others
myself, and thus crucially work out
salvation through trembling (the fear has abated),
but just *whose* salvation remains to be seen.
I won't be there to see it, having
other things to be, and until then
I work for another. Is this, then, the point?
Or does this too not satisfy? What of the wind
and my place in it?
