*Friend in Need
27 February 2026

You know we never really gave love a try.
This has all been preparation.
But nothing has happened to preclude the possibility
of trying someday, just as nothing ensures that we *will* try.
But I will walk beside you like this for as long as you need me to.
I once needed the same kind of help,
and I will not turn a blind eye to a friend in need.
