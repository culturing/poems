New Clarity
27 February 2026

New clarity after the expulsion of demons.
The attraction was real, but she and I
are in different phases of life, and would want different things
from love. So she was *very* serious, but playing 
the game of self-discovery, not the game of building a home.
It remains a bit tragic, but at least not evil.
It should have been clear (and in fact it was clear)
that this would be the case, but the pull was too strong
to resist. What follows? Could there be a second act
years hence, when she's ready to settle down?

It's not *impossible*,
but I must direct my energies elsewhere,
toward my own life. I feel ready to do so.
I am stronger now. That's something.
