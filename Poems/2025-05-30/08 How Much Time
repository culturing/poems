*How Much Time
30 May 2025

How much time must pass,
how many ages fade
before we build to last,
before our debt is paid?

We labor, it is true,
amid the factories and glass,
but skies are sometimes blue,
and one would like to ask,

What purpose serves the labor?
It is very hard to prove
that working hard can save her
who is troubled by our mood.

But no more questions,
for they do not seek an answer.
It is only in the quest for more
that life has any savor.
