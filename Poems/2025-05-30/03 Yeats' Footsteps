Yeats' Footsteps
30 May 2025

If I follow Yeats' footsteps
to the gates of Constantine's city,
what will I find? A sense of order,
perhaps, most lacking in the West,
but one we can borrow? I doubt it,
as much as I share the longing,
for we are committed to Roman belligerence,
scions of the eternal city. What care we
for order or harmony? Conquest is too much fun.
