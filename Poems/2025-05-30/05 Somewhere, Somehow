Somewhere, Somehow
30 May 2025

What are we building? A kingdom,
a fiefdom, for a new rule of law?
We have been to the top of the pyramid,
discovering Nothing, the black hole consuming
all those who pursue reputation. But what 
are *we* building? It is not enough to tear down.
We will have to live somewhere, somehow.
