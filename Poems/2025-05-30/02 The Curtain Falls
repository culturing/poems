The Curtain Falls
30 May 2025

The curtain falls on a people in pain.
"God is dead" says a man born insane.
There is nowhere to run. There is nowhere to hide.
They are standing alone in the rain.

A jester appears by their side.
He is laughing though he is no guide.
Tomorrow, he says, is no longer.
His apple is tempting their pride.

Still, he is certainly stronger
than those who prefer to fear-monger.
But even the laughter must wane.
And then what remains?
