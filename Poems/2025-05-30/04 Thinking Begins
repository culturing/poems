*Thinking Begins
30 May 2025

This is an impression made concrete,
the birth of ideas, the origin of reason
(of one chain of reason), and next comes 
deduction, and then experiment. But listen,
friend, for the sounds of inspiration
made manifest by one who has had his thumb
on the pulse of time. Only after this,
thinking begins.
