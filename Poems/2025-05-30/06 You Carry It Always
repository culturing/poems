*You Carry It Always
30 May 2025

The Spectator steps through the door
into Nothing, aware of himself and the other
selves of which he is part, falling faster
than rhythm or rhyme can describe. It's a pity
no home was awaiting, but this is no time
to look back. With feet braced and arched back
he descends through the labyrinth of thought
toward origins, never a settled being, forever
turned forward and moving with things that flow.
But you know he remembers another time,
before he was here, before any here was,
in the space between thinking and being,
the caverns of essence, brimming with glittering stones.
I would like to show you this place,
to invite to your mind a new feeling,
the oldest knowing, which hereafter reigns
as it always must reign, although so few can know
(are you one of them?). Look to the hills
for the meaning of meaning, and you will not find it,
but look to your heart and it's there, where
it cannot be dislodged by violence
or brought to account by tribunals...it's there,
and you carry it, always.
