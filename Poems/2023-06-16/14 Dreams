*Dreams
16 June 2023

When I consider the teenagers over the way,
I'm amazed that they have not been disciplined,
growing so free and inviolate, much like I was
when I thought men could grow up like trees
and touch clouds. Now I know, as we say,
growing never gets old, and all youth is perennial,
transferred across generations, but what is
this secret? If not the true meaning, how
shall we decipher one deeper? The struggle
for youth to make good its ambition for harmony
shall never die, though we shall. Shall we
scold them? I say it's no use, because
life is quite able to punish them all on its own.
Let them dream, and let us still remember
that dreams are the province of youth, across time,
even ours.
