Pain That One Calls Home
16 June 2023

We are out here searching for something,
a meaning of some kind, some explanation,
but all that we really needed was in us,
they say, all along. Is it, though? Or
are we still adrift in a godless nothing,
at last on the verge of discovering
forms that administer the pain 
that one calls home?
