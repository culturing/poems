*Rolling Waves
16 June 2023

I am going out to sea,
wish you would join me.
It is rough to go alone,
and no fair hands can grasp
the terrors that await those
who set sail. But do go with me,
and I'll promise you enlightenment
without the heavy falsehoods
of the earthbound ways of man.
I hope you'll understand.
I have no more remorse for life
than dead men have for dying,
but the rolling waves are calling
all the same.
