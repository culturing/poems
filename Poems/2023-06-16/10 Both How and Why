Both How and Why
16 June 2023

It is unwise to blame bad sheep
for bad shepherding. Where are the
greener pastures? Not near the factories,
that much is sure, but one also begins
to wonder if shepherds have ever known,
or if they have simply usurped
crook and the staff, out of lust
for power. But then, some sheep thrive
and we must ask them both how and why.
