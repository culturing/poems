Better Judgment
16 June 2023

It is time to reflect, to remember
what words have been spoken, to justify
all that precedes who we are. It's not easy,
like life, and like all of life's dreams.
But go with me toward it, and we
shall be we, not afraid or unbalanced as they,
but as free, we shall breathe different airs,
contra Kennedy, and against our better judgment.
