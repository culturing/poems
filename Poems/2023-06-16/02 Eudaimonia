Eudaimonia
16 June 2023

In a room of thinkers, I was quiet,
until each had taken his turn. I heard
the arguments of Socrates and Zoroaster
firmly interrupted by Confucius, who thought
he might intervene and end the struggle.
But all any of them wanted was to understand
what man is, even Nietzsche, who embarassed
countless Germans, and his proteg√©, one
Heidegger, who smoothed those rougher edges.
Now all thinking ever was was thinking,
this much we endorse, as thinkers,
as the only ones. But what of friends
sent from afar? Brought near by ritual?
Is not this eudaimonia?
