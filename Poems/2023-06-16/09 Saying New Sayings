Saying New Sayings
16 June 2023

The Supreme Intelligence in all of its forms
must be killed, but then maybe it's already
taken a mortal blow, dealt by wizards
of German extraction, and some
have moved on, some have not,
but how are we to organize
friendship in commerce, political life,
or religion, without the old sayings?
Perhaps start by saying new sayings?
