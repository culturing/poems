What Surprises Remain
16 June 2023

With a small bit of horsepower,
with little to lose, I have gone
and sublated Hegel, just as
he requires, but what, then, remains?
If not Plato or Aristotle, maybe Aquinas?
But these three won't do
in a world that grows tired of λόγος.
Let's try on Confucius,
and see what surprises remain.
