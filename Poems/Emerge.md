In America, we know God  
changes his mind. We oblige him  
with all of our talk about time  
and Democracy. Where, after all,  
does one find something permanent.  
Surely not here, where we bind  
ourselves freely to change, and await  
the next Mind, with its talk  
about how all is fine.  
But ennui is outdated when we  
feel confined by ourselves,  
when our origins, soaking with brine,  
emerge fresh from the foam to remind us  
that we know God changes his mind.
