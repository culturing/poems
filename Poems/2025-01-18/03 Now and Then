*Now and Then
18 January 2025

The artist scours an empty mind
to remove any residue. Then he begins.
He must find his misfortune in asking
what questions are askable, and by whom.
It will be no quick summary, no
sudden triumph, but rather the slow decline
of all that has come before. Only then
will he lift his brush or pen, to define
what will grow in new spaces, what begs
to be heard, or what utters the gulf
between now and then.
