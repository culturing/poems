Never Been Wrong
18 January 2025

I've never been wrong before,
but there's a first time for everything,
like that time when two plus two equalled five,
or when men lived together in peace.

Still I'm tramping on
through this wasteland of abandoned dreams.
I find a few worth keeping, and yet
all is not what it seems.
