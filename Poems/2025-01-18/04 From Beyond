From Beyond
18 January 2025

How many cultures have come and gone,
and how many days remain unborn
in the cavernous womb of the world?
What is time, that it comes and goes,
and yet some things remain, like the Ship
of Theseus? Washed here by time, we have no eyes
for what could have been or will be.
We are stranded, denied true transcendence,
but seeing things come from beyond.
