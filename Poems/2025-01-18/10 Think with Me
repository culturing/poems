Think with Me
18 January 2025

I do not know where you are going
or where you have been, but I think
you are here and suspect that you
really are somewhere. Think *with* me,
and allow these still words to move again,
through your soul. I am warning you,
many ideas are dangerous, and you,
only you, are the one who can help yourself know,
which will help you, and which will hurt you.
