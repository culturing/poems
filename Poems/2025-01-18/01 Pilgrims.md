Pilgrims
18 January 2025

Sheep remain sheep, like most men,
and I know of no other way for them,
but I know that my own way is different,
and therefore has differing rewards.

I'm alone, it is true, but I'm also free,
and that's part of the American dream.
More importantly, I have seen God
in the hidden places, those which no group may enter,
where each one is man and man only,
no tribe to fend off the attackers.
God dwells there, in a holy of holies,
awaiting the pilgrims who soon must come.
