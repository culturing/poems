*Keener Insight and Better Plans
18 January 2025

In a few years the world will look different
and we are to blame or to praise,
but it's too late to stop it now.
In a few years, days, months, hours,
the sun will continue its circuit
as we, silly, unravel our momentum,
and reveal who we were when decisions were made,
back when things could change. Things keep changing,
of course, as expected, but I hope
for a day with keener insight and better plans.
