Children
31 January 2026

In truth, I did not want children for the longest time,
but you have almost changed my mind. How funny, that my doubts
were cleared by a woman with doubts of her own. One of nature's jokes.
But I am not set either way, and in truth I consider it folly
to make this decision alone. It takes two, not only to do it,
but even to choose to do it, and I would not choose without you.

Could I live with you, happily, just us?
I think that I could.
But we must know our reasons for choosing as we do.
