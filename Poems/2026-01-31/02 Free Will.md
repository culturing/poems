    <blockquote>Education should aim at destroying free will, so that, after pupils are thus schooled, they will be incapable, throughout the rest of their lives, of thinking or acting otherwise than as their schoolmasters would have wished.</blockquote>

For centuries, the German barbarians
were acquainted with the sharp end of civilization,
the stick that beats down rowdy spirit in the name of order.
They have never recovered.

They now know only that stick
or wild abandon.
