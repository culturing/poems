*Hair on Fire
31 January 2026

You are beautiful even with your hair on fire,
but not in the way you might think, or fear. It's your courage,
not your purity, that I admire. I have no need for idols,
I swore off them long ago, in a valediction to images.
You have that hidden song that embraces the shadow
as part of the whole. I would hear you sing it, 
then master it, then sing it some more.
