*What You Are Fighting For
31 January 2026

You have spoken again. I will need some time
to decipher the clues, but the timing speaks volumes.
Or would you like me to deconstruct you?
I like your sharp edge, have no doubt, but I see also
softness that would like to come out. There's a place
where that softness can know it belongs. You are right
where life brought you, and fight if you must, but remember
what you are fighting for.
