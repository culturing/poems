*The Beast In Man
31 January 2026

Or are we still in the labyrinth? Are these your minotaurs?
Half-man, half-beast, or the beast-in-man...it is time
that I told you a secret: the beast is deathless, it cannot be killed,
but it can be soothed, even tamed, and made to do tricks
(like these), or put to good use plowing fields.
