    <blockquote>
        Woman, your words have cut me to the core.</br>
        Who has moved my bed? That would be a hard task,</br>
        even for the most skilled craftsman, unless a god</br>
        himself came down and with ease chose to shift it.</br>
        No mortal man alive, not in his prime,</br>
        could lightly prize it from its place. A great secret</br>
        lies in that bed's craftsmanship. It was my work,</br>
        my own, and no one else's.</br>
        </br>
        Inside our court there grew a long-leaved olive tree,</br>
        flourishing and full, its trunk as thick as a pillar.</br>
        Around this I built my chamber, stone by stone,</br>
        and roofed it well, and hung close-fitting doors.</br>
        Then I lopped the foliage of that long-leaved olive,</br>
        and trimmed the trunk from the root up, and with my adze</br>
        planed it smooth and true, and to the line made it straight,</br>
        fashioning a bedpost. I bored it all with an auger.</br>
        </br>
        Beginning with this post, I built my bed,</br>
        until it was finished, inlaid with gold and silver</br>
        and ivory. And I stretched on it a thong of ox-hide,</br>
        shining with purple dye.</br>
        </br>
        There is our secret. And I do not know,</br>
        woman, if my bed is still fast, or if some man</br>
        has cut the olive trunk and moved it elsewhere.</br>

I have planted the tree
that could grow into the sturdiest bedpost
of a bed that cannot be moved.
