As Life May Yet Be
17 January 2023

Wordsworth said of a poem:
emotion recalled in tranquility.
Now I say otherwise. Mine
are like ships tossed by storms,
lost at sea, like reality, never
at port in the kingdom of sheep
who fight no significant battles
and want things done for them --
adventurer poems, explorer poems,
as anxious as life may yet me.
