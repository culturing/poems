Horizons

*Where did we get the sponge that could wipe the horizon away?*
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Nietzsche

From Cromwell it came, with vengeance,
for days were not trusted
as long as a Catholic lived, and
with Providence on our side
we strove forth for Britannia,
Science and War side by side.
It was then that the ground
was made firm,
and thus all are now born
in laboratories, laboring, true,
for some queen they know not,
some Elizabeth mouldering probably,
but no true woman. No man of science
fares well with a woman, no wonder,
for women *require* horizons, and science
requires the sponge. But no matter,
has Germany fared any better, or
must we look deeper
and learn of Greek/Roman horizons?
