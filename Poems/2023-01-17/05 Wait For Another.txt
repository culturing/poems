Wait For Another
17 January 2023

In the aftermath of clockwork decaying,
from prisons of the mind, arise new men
of stone unbroken and yet brittle to the end.
What for? If Ãœbermenchen all, then we
are lofty though we fall, for with some hopes
a certain madness lurks in wait. Say more,
bon esprit, with less. Do be the best, but
know of other figures at the door.
You are no child now, new friend, you grown-old thing,
yet I have seldom felt such shelter from your wing.
Is this, then progress? Or must we wait for another?
