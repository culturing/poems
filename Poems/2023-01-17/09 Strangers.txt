Strangers
17 January 2023

As I sit by candlelight,
I know the strangers of the night
who creep by windows fair and bright
to haunt the streets of our delight,
and all the days of love grown old
and all the stories never told
and all the crying eyes behold
the lying eyes both young and old.

I see them in their shadows waiting,
see their fearful forms debating
whether love or lies abating
offer respite to their waiting,
whether love or lies can stir
the shadows that have stolen her,
the one whose love was soft like fur
now bristles with a prickly hide.

Come sit by my candlelight,
and feast your eyes upon this sight,
as strangers in the strangest night
sit man and man, sit side by side.
