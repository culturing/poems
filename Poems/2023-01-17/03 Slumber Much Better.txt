Slumber Much Better
17 January 2023

Again I find myself alone
in the dark, while the Christians
dance madly in imaginary light.
What a pity that all of this
suffering goes on unpunished.
I think there will come a time
for licking these wounds, but
until then I slumber much
better without interference.
