Sick With Struggle
17 January 2023

Here we are, still monotheist saints
or else old hoplites with no phalanx,
sick with struggle, and yet knowing of no other...
what voice calls? Is it the morning dove,
or is it just fair Juliet, the wise man's bane?
She has no other name, for she is fair
no longer than a season. All loves end
the same, as sorrows waver, with a whimper,
and mankind remains enthralled to thee,
O time, the muse of all deep divers,
dwelling as you do beneath the waves.
