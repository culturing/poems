*Forever To Yourself Be True
09 December 2025

All is quiet, and it's eerie
how the day sits calm and ready
after pulverizing night into a million pieces.
*Is* this what was needed? I have doubts,
but not so many that regret creeps in.
This could not be avoided or conceded, no,
it had to run its course. But what comes next?
Perhaps a time of rest and healing, or perhaps
a birth of love, but now, in either case,
let's praise the gods that brought us here
and see them face to face.

--

These gods were jealous, and they would not
let things be, and now for you and me
a tug ties us together, though it sets us free.
Remember me, as I remember you, and to yourself
be true. Forever to yourself be true.
