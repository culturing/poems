*New Moon Phase
09 December 2025

A bitter wind rips through even the warmest attire.
I may *aspire* to love, but can I see it through?
This much is true: I'd like to try, though I can offer
nothing painless, nothing free of life's dark questions,
only earnest striving, chasing down a dream,
for in between the light small fragments of night
have nestled, and remain...and to dislodge them
would endanger the patient. Still, they can be tolerated,
maybe even loved, as parts of a whole, but they
are not the whole itself. The light still shines, and with it
dignity is never out of reach. So reach, and grasp life
with both hands, and be amazed. In all your days
you have not known this new moon phase.
