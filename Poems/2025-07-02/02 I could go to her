*I could go to her
02 July 2025

On the doorstep of adventure, I write to you
(one last time?) about all that could be.
You will know so much better than I
what became of myself, whether obstacles
or I proved stronger. But here on this precipice
overlooking all, I confess it, 
I feel afraid. Is it courage or hubris
that pushes me on? Is it time? Or
is it mere chemistry, stirring these bones
with infusions of blood? I don't know,
but I do know that I must linger
and dwell within this possibility: she is there.
I could go to her. I could also be there.
