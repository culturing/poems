Just One Moment More
02 July 2025

Back to myself, coming home, it's a wonder
that any can dream, that the dreaming goes on
amid war, amid pain...can it be? or are dreams
merely dreams? But who authors them? I do not know,
though I think that we do it together. So why
be alone? That I do know. Because I am drawn to the water
of origins, back before any were separate, I feel
its love far more strongly than any love of mammals.
I feel that the earth is my home,
and no smaller home will do.
So I wander in spirit, awaiting
the needed recommunion, unable to settle
or build any firm foundation, because
I know none will suffice.
And yet it was nice to believe,
to be free, then no more be deceived.
It was nice, and I choose to remember
before I forget, and to dwell and to linger
among all the sugar and spice
for just one moment more.
