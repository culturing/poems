Woken by Storms
02 July 2025

Climbing back down, into sheets of myself,
I have danced at the summit of dreams,
but no longer. The way goes through many a village,
all dark, with no room at the inn. But no matter.
I must venture on as my only companion,
I must face the frost with no fear in my heart,
lest the others be woken by storms.
