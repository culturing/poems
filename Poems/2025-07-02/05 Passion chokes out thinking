Passion chokes out thinking
02 July 2025

How many thoughts must I lose
to distraction, to chasing dreams
or ghosts of dreams? It is written
that I shall abide here. In time
you will understand, you will follow the thread
back to daylight, and nurse your own wounds.
Why then linger? Why hope? Is Pandora
still casting her curse? It gets worse.
She is queen of this world, and her gifts
must inspire destruction. Who hails
from a distant land? Who knows
or cares, when passion chokes out thinking
in its slumber?
