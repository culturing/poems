The Land of the Same
02 July 2025

Who is the boss of them, clambering
after Forever, in search of some other world,
if that world is not real? Who's to say,
whether this is permitted or that? They forget
how to answer these questions. Afraid of the dark,
they burn five-hundred candles each night,
as Zoroaster might prescribe, to no avail.
The dark reemerges in sleep, in dreams,
and in each indecision that comes their way.
Who's to say, when nobody can *say* at all,
in the country of echoes, the land of the same?
