*Make my dreams true
02 July 2025

There comes a time when a man
is whole, and can truly say yes. That time
may be coming for me, but the hour is late
and so many decisions have already been made.
Is it true? My heart beats for her,
yes, it is true. But am I fit for love,
or for even attempted love,
after all this time? Worms will eat through
all things, so they say, so what lasts?
Only dreams, but is love but a dream?
I'll dream longer, and make my dreams true.
