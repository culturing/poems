What's Best For You
14 December 2025

I can answer for myself, my whims and stray thoughts,
and even my sins are a part of the whole. But I find a new fear
at the threshold of love, like a note just barely out of tune,
a small blemish, one felt before it's understood. If you could,
wait for me, but keep asking: should this love come true?
Then do what's best for you.
