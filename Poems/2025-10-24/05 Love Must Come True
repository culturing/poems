*Love Must Come True
24 October 2025

I have gone into the closets of my mind
and through the cobwebs, under dust and piles of bones
I found a beating heart, now stronger than before.
It is no mystery that lingers, but the surest thing,
the soul of life on earth. It is unbreakable.
And now it seems to glow and shine through darkness
and the vast expanse of heaven. Now it lingers
as a solemn prayer, the hope of one whose voyage
has found port, the only answer to the only question.

Love, my friends...go find it, and then all will be revealed.

--

Into the fathomless, into the reaches of ecstasy,
agony, joy, and pain, the wonders of being
and desolation's pang, all is here, in this beating heart.
It has mastered the sea and found land at last,
but the soil needs much tilling and forests must fall
before any warm home could abide here. And so to that work
I now dedicate all that remains of my life,
every ounce of my strength and each moment of time
to the work that makes good on the promise that love
must come true.

--

And yet we *make* it true, we devise the contraptions
whereby one and one become one, and *we* work and *we* build,
but what drives this activity? Can it be other than heaven?
Can any imperative ever be other than heaven? We'd like to control
everything, but so far it seems these most important things
control us. And so let it be so. Let the world keep on turning,
the sun keep on rising, the seasons keep changing, and love keep on growing
of its own volition, with us as its vessels, enraptured
but not without reason.
