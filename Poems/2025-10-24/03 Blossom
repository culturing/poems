*Blossom
24 October 2025

It's not too late to start over,
to ask who or what we might be,
and to act on it, letting ourselves
be revealed. It is never too late,
for not even cold fate can deny
the imperative to blossom. So blossom.
Unfurl your bright petals, expose
your sweet nectar, and bring into life
what sleeps deeply within you. This beauty
will answer for itself.
