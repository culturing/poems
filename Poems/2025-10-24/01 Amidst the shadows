Amidst the shadows
24 October 2025

There is no East or West
but only the continuous circle,
the circumference of the earth.
Who then devised the scheme
whereby mankind must be divided?
Who told East to begin and West to end?
We did, and do. These symbols linger,
as all symbols linger, underneath
the conscious mind, where shadows fight
themselves, and all we want is peace.
But peace is hard to find,
and we have been unkind to others
and ourselves. But peace arrives
in sudden and unexpected surprise
amidst the shadows, even here
in our own hearts.
