Babylon
05 February 2026

Perhaps it is time to stop dreaming. I sense a danger
that I cannot name, but it's not myself at risk.
I will go through the winding halls of Babylon
again, if it might save another, even one.
I will summon the fire that leaves its mark.
But this is not a place one should wander alone.
I have my companions tucked deep inside. They will answer
if answer they must. When fires engulf the city,
I know where I can run. And I know I can make it. Can you?
Friend, don't underestimate your peril. This is a place
of wildness, where laws bend and break on a whim.
