*Only to Strengthen
05 February 2026

The ultimate degradation
is the surrender of self-preservation.
When this is lost, one becomes
a victim, at the mercy of others,
and of life itself, an infant again
but without the mother's protection.

Surrendering even volition and all self-love
may *seem* sublime to one who does not
know better, but such gifts always prove
worthless, and less than worthless,
a genuine burden.

I would love only to strengthen
myself and my beloved.
