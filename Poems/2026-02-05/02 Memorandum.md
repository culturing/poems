*Memorandum Re: Delineation of Romantic Intentions*

It has come to our attention that you exist.
We have been made aware that you are of a certain age
with certain proportions suitable to activities of a sensitive nature.
We would like to investigate this matter.
We are certain that the future of the human race depends on it.

At your earliest convenience, return the attached form,
filling in the bubble for "Yes" or "No".
Do not use the "Maybe" bubble.
Do not fill in both "Yes" and "No".
And fill in the bubble completely,
our machines are known to be temperamental.
