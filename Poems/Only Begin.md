<small>*For J. Alfred Prufrock and his admirers*</small>

If I could only begin,  
I would end alright.  
But time is riddled with sin.

Lovers never win  
with all their might.  
If I could only begin

To tell you all of thick and thin  
I might get things right.  
But time is riddled with sin.

So let me come in,  
up out of this night.  
Then I could begin

To speak in both sound and sight  
of ample groves and measured flight.  
But time is riddled with sin,  
so I could only begin.
