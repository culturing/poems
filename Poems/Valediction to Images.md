Image of forgotten beauty,  
Face of fire, flesh of music,  
Laughter-loving Aphrodite,  
Be not high or mighty  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the altar of my heart.

Rosy cheeks on satin faces,  
Eyes that call the heart to race,   
O, sculpture of amazing graces,  
Shatter. There are empty places  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep within my heart.

Come instead, you hidden song,  
You dying fall withholding all,  
And I will hear you long,  
For I can hear you call   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From deep within the altar of my heart.
