*Journey of the Self
25 February 2026

The journey of the self, from small
to medium to large, what a wonderful event!
The growth of a man or woman depends
on external nourishment, not unlike a plant,
but more perilous. Plants are less prone to violence,
less likely to hurt those who help them.
But plants are less capable, worth less
than a fully developed human. How does one
grow up? It can only be trial and error.
