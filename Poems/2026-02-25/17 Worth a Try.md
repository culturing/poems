Worth a Try
25 February 2026

It really was worth a try, you know, in the absence
of complete information. I fear she is hideous
under the skin. There are few other explanations remaining.
What a silly girl, to treat love like a toy, as if
she might escape unscathed. I've no room for that,
though she may grow out of it, let someone else find out.
