Pain
25 February 2026

How the pain swirls now...was it worth it?
And could I have avoided it? This burning desire
transforms into ache, the knowledge of unfulfillment.
How I wanted her...it's a strange want.
I don't know what I wanted exactly. Did I want
to be received? Cherished? Loved? Understood?
Perhaps all of the above. Did she fake it?
I see both the nightmare and the daydream,
as Taylor joked, but I mean no jest. I'm afraid
of this power, its hold over me, but I doubt
that this power is *her*. It's some stronger thing,
pulling us both, us *all*, into a dance
that we never can fully control. I must let
these desires cool in their own time. I cannot
control them. I only control my behavior.
