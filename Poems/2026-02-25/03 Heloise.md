Heloise
25 February 2026

Well, Heloise, I guess this is goodbye.
It has been a pleasure almost knowing you.
I think this encounter has served its purpose, or at least
as much of that purpose as can be served right now.
You will be just fine, some day,
maybe sooner than you think.
Please take care of yourself until then.
