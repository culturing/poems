Dealbreaker
25 February 2026

Vanda really is a dealbreaker for me.
After her, I just cannot believe that this blurring of lines between art and life
has been anything other than a trick all along, a devious seduction.
Is that not what this play means? Save your tears
for somebody else, unless you are willing to confront your behavior
and deal with me as an adult.

If it has been a trick, and if I
am the butt of the joke, you are pitiable,
to humiliate a serious suitor, and for what?
It cannot have made you happy. I do not deserve
the punishment of Venus, but you do.
You certainly do.
