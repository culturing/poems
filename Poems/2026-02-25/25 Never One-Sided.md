*Never One-Sided
25 February 2026

I cannot believe that such passions are ever one-sided.
With Jung, I believe they are a product of relation,
of interaction in some astral realm of consciousness. Whatever it means
to be "close", so we were, and still are, to a painful degree.
I don't know that this closeness is welcome now. It was always
discomforting, except for a brief shining moment of near total surrender.
From here, we can only climb up and out of the den of carnality.
The world is no different than it ever was, but we may have changed.
It was a worthy effort, not because of some high, some transaction
between pain and pleasure, but because it brought broadened horizons
and new possibilities. In short, we have grown, and that's more than nothing.
