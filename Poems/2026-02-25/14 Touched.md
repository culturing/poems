Touched
25 February 2026

I have found her *interesting*, and more, perhaps,
and I know not to force the heart to let go.
It will fade in time, and join the background noise
of other failed loves, and the memories that one
can never quite enjoy or despise.
We will live our lives as we always have.
I do hope I have touched her life
in return for the ways she's touched mine.
