Any Longer
25 February 2026

Most likely she doesn't know either.
Even if she thinks she has found some power,
manipulation is always a sign of weakness.
I don't know what she accomplished, or meant to accomplish,
to teach me that women are evil,
that sex is poison, that love is a mistake?
I will not believe it. Misery, they say,
loves company, and if she believes these things
she is worthy of pity. I do not believe
she is bound to darkness, though shadows
abide in her...but she is not my problem
any longer.
