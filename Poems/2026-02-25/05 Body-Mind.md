Body/Mind
25 February 2026

The body is the foundation for spirit,
and out of it all else grows. There is no
fundamental antagonism, no mind/body distinction, 
but a healthy collaboration.
Always mindbody combines in a swirling nomos/physis.
To exercise nomos means first and foremost
to *care for* one's own physis and not wage wars against it.
In the realm of pure body, there is no mind at all,
no cosmic Mind shaping all. Every nomos is added by man, and therefore
grows out of and depends on the body as much as controls it. 
Ask not which comes first,
for both have existed forever in immortal tension,
eternal release, at least insofar as humanity is concerned.
But if I had to guess,
I'd say physis came first, for it serves
as the telos and motivation for nomos.
There is no Mind without Body,
but there sure is Body without Mind.
