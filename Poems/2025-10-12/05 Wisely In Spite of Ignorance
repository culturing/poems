Wisely in Spite of Ignorance
12 October 2025

Open the eternal secrets,
pour the libations of hope
and give fuel to the flame.
It is tame now. The sky has subsided
and only the earth remains.
But there's no peace on earth,
not while mankind endures.
So I'll cling to the sky
and hold fast to some passing cloud
to protect me from sunlight
and all its wild children.

Is life good or bad?
Will we ever know?

Or must we choose wisely
in spite of ignorance?
