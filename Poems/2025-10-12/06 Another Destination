Another Destination
12 October 2025

I cannot understand it,
how the vagaries of forgotten time
bring love around and around again,
the ones I loved and the ones who loved me
rarely meeting on equal terms. Who can say it?
Love fails more often than not, 
but we cannot stop trying
or else we give up life itself.

Is there another destination,
some plateau whence comes the glaring eye
of fate, which pulls me thence
through all these vagaries? I doubt it,
but I cannot yet disprove it.
