*Make Me More Worthy
12 October 2025

Into curiosities, mystically entwined,
I wait for answers, seeing questions leave their mark.
But hark! the herald comes from afar with news,
and days from now, in another life,
I may greet thee, dear friend, as a changed man.
But for now, I can only hope, standing perched
on the needle of time, swaying to and fro
like a stylite surprised by a powerful wind,
wind that tore through the valley of my heart
leaving canyons in what I mistook for bedrock.
And now I would have it no other way,
swaying wildly and laughing with a wind
that decides who we are. I can only say
make me more worthy to bathe in this holy air,
fill me with laughter and the hope that comes
from your sweet touch.
