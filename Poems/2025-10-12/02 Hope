Hope
12 October 2025

Hope is a curious predicament,
lodged as it always is
between certainties, positive and negative.
Some things *could* be, or become,
but are not, as things stand.
What a strange isolation,
a habitat for a kind of creature
so different from modern science
with its fetish for certain propositions,
its talisman of purest certainty.
Hope is not clear, nor is it distinct,
but it can lead to life,
and all new life begins with some hope.
So let's hope, but with clear-eyed humility,
aware of our limits, aware of what truly comes to pass.
