The New World
25 April 2017

Raised among wolves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we've learned both bite and howl,
but there is a new kind of life coming now.

An old life more truly,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one ought to be sure.
Allow me to answer, I've no sinecure.

Upon an old hill
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there stood men young and old.
They bore a fierce wind and were bold.

As one with one purpose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they built there together
foundations to outlast all weather.

That edifice fell,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the ruins remain.
Do any dare build there again?
