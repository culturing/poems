Raised among wolves,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we've learned both bite and howl,  
but there is a new kind of life coming now.

An old life more truly,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one ought to be sure.  
Allow me to answer, I've no sinecure.

Upon an old hill  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there stood men young and old.  
They bore a fierce wind and were bold.

As one with one purpose  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they built there together  
foundations to outlast all weather.

That edifice fell,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the ruins remain.  
Do any dare build there again?
