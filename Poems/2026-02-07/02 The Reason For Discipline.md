*The Reason For Discipline
07 February 2026

Those who develop a taste for cruelty
often must be put down, like a bear
that has tasted human flesh, and is therefore
more likely to seek the same. But you
are no bear, and your only hope
lies with society, the source of food
and warmth. This is the reason
for discipline, the only reason that satisfies
the wildness within...even wildness knows
not to bite the hand that feeds it. And yet
we are animals in part and forever
'til death, which is surely our end, not
the end of the life that flows through us.
