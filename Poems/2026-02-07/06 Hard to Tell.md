*Hard to Tell
07 February 2026

Now, having laid out my position
and thwarted some potential demons,
I return to your likely purpose,
to affirm and acknowledge
this ongoing stream of poems,
this strangest courtship. It suits us, 
you know (you know better than most), but I wish
you would not flip the script or mix signals.
I wish I didn't have to work hard
to decipher you. It's not a healthy basis
for what I would like to build. Am I
this confusing, mercurial, and vague?
Perhaps, but it's hard to tell.
