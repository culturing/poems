Cruelty
07 February 2026

I can taste your cruelty, even in the midst
of positive signals. I do not know if I like the taste.
But I know where my limits are, and my line in the sand
encloses my dignity. I will not give that up,
not even for love. You must ask yourself
whether I would be any good to you 
after receiving your cruelty,
or if I would soon be deformed, degraded, eventually
discarded, or cruel in return. It is not absolutely forbidden,
you are free to be cruel, but it is a bad idea,
and likely less thrilling than you imagine.

But maybe you need to try it
and see for yourself.
