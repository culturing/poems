*Extraordinary Discipline
07 February 2026

Love is not truly unconditional,
not when it's human to human,
for humans have limits, and all
are vulnerable to cruelty
and the degradation it brings.
So let's not pretend. But this
does not make love impossible,
it only makes it difficult and rare.
It requires extraordinary discipline.
