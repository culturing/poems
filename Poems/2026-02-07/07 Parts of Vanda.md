Parts of Vanda
07 February 2026

I do see what you've done,
and I do like it,
but I have some concerns.
Which parts of Vanda
did you mean to convey?
She compliments the writer, but
turns out to be a fabulist,
and Thomas is not someone I'd admire.

--

And yet your Vanda seems more *sincere*,
more genuinely hurt by the fear of misunderstanding.
Let me speak to her: she has not misunderstood.
In fact, she has arrived right on time.

--

But I must make one thing clear:
there is a real danger in what Vanda and Thomas discover,
and we have that danger inside of us too.
It is not to be taken lightly. It is not a toy.
It is life and death. It demands respect.

--

Venus in Fur
is a comedy
but ought to be a tragedy.

--

But is your Vanda manipulative,
or is she merely afraid
she has made a mistake?

--

You've removed some manipulative lines,
about the guy on the train and being soaked to the skin,
so I think I will take my chances that you are sincere, but naive...
but I will pay attention for signals suggesting otherwise.

--

When Vanda is not sincere,
Thomas would do better
to not be alone with her.
