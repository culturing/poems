What a strange pain you have caused me, and I do not know
if you meant it, or if this is simply
the pain of reality. Are you this blurry? Is this the truth?
Then I wonder how love could be possible, with less than wild abandon,
and I am not one for wild abandon. I'll see this thing through,
whatever it is, whether love or guidance or some terrible mistake.
Maybe you have not understood me as well as I thought or hoped.
I would love to know. Or maybe you are on your own path
and must do what you must.
