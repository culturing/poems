*Waking, Dreamlike
08 January 2026

I have no use for fantasies.
I want the real thing.
Can ugly truth deflate the dream?
Then had it any worth?

Life is more than dreams, although
our dreams do make much difference.
They inspire us to grow.
They chart the ways that we must go.

But one can lose oneself in dreaming,
one can sleep and never step.
This is a sign that something lingers
undigested in the head.

But is it also not a sign
that men make gods from dreams?
And do these gods rule over us?
We are not as we seem.

One can learn to ride the waves,
and one can still believe.
But two or more can become brave,
for only two are free.

Free to make their gods together,
free at last to dream,
but in a waking, dreamlike life
where they are as they seem.
