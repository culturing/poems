*Ariadne II
08 January 2026

Ariadne, I liked you better
before you became a goddess, with Theseus,
not Dionysius, though I did intend to invert the ending
and not leave you stranded on Naxos.
Still I can see why you'd like Dionysius
after years as the mistress of the labyrinth, where your father the King
enforced holy order despite all winding ways.
But the god of wine is unlikely to fill your cup for long
and deserves nothing close to total devotion. You might have done better
as queen of Athens, had circumstances allowed it.
