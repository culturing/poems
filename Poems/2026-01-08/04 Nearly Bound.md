*Nearly Bound
08 January 2026

Somehow this thing keeps developing,
two together though apart
growing closer in heart, with no need
to make manifest that which grows.
But who knows? If we fail
at the coming appointment,
won't there be another? It's hard
to doubt, and getting harder.
Is this your doing? If so,
keep weaving, Ariadne. 
I'm nearly bound.
