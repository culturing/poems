Live By Dying
08 January 2026

I stand at the threshold gazing
into the future, a future made full by hope,
for even these possibilities change my world,
come what may. How can I, a mere man,
challenge fate, even should it decree
that all happiness comes with suffering?
Is that my state? Or can I live
by dying, and die for life's sake?
