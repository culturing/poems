### Romance Revisited

Unsurprised when she appeared \
atop the stair,\
unsought and yet on cue,\
I smiled.

There we were again.

More than sounds were heard,\
more said than words\
as we relieved the burn\
that itched for all those years.

Something in that breeze\
put love at ease,\
and all those memories\
in Sunday Best conceived \
some reparation, \
some demand.

But lives diverge,\
conform to their courses,\
drive towards their ends.

This, then, too must end.

--

But if we flee from time,\
abandon all but dreams,

Elide the pulls of Jupiter\
and Venus,

Would we weary of the world we’d made?

Must immortal Love's embrace\
ignore all time and place?

--

Rage for futility,\
Rage for bleared horizons,

For rage itself,\
which vanquishes sages,\
and for the mortal dream.

But though to many moons I've sighed, \
and though those eyes when met with mine\
still come to life to think of all that was \
and what could be, it is not time.

Though it is right.

For time flows suddenly to exit youth.

--

Let us go then, you and I,\
to die, and not trace ways\
across that sky\
where the Immortals lie.

We belong implanted\
where the bloom that Spring provides\
by Autumn flees, and we get by\
on hardened leaves.
