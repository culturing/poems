Unsurprised when she appeared   
atop the stair,  
unsought and yet on cue,  
I smiled.

There we were again.

More than sounds were heard,  
more said than words  
as we relieved the burn  
that itched for all those years.

Something in that breeze  
put love at ease,  
and all those memories  
in Sunday Best conceived   
some reparation,   
some demand.

But lives diverge,  
conform to their courses,  
drive towards their ends.

This, then, too must end.

--

But if we flee from time,  
abandon all but dreams,

Elide the pulls of Jupiter  
and Venus,

Would we weary of the world weâ€™d made?

Must immortal Love's embrace  
ignore all time and place?

--

Rage for futility,  
Rage for bleared horizons,

For rage itself,  
which vanquishes sages,  
and for the mortal dream.

But though to many moons I've sighed,   
and though those eyes when met with mine  
still come to life to think of all that was   
and what could be, it is not time.

Though it is right.

For time flows suddenly to exit youth.

--

Let us go then, you and I,  
to die, and not trace ways  
across that sky  
where the Immortals lie.

We belong implanted  
where the bloom that Spring provides  
by Autumn flees, and we get by  
on hardened leaves.
