*The Drums of Alexander
20 March 2023

Alexander stood finally tall on Persepolis
burning. This was the vengeance Ionia craved,
the dream of a thousand hoplites realized at last.
But what was that wind? O great King,
have you done this? And had you no doubts?
Later on one will stand here and wonder
as you failed to wonder. Were not these
baths lovely, with children at play in the spring?
Rubble now, though perhaps all ends thus,
though perhaps not as swiftly as this.
Have you done it, or does some Ahura
still haunt these hallowed grounds? What was
really at stake, basileus, in so much destruction?
And why do I still hear your drums beating,
louder now, over the Atlantic?
