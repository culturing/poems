So Very Greek
20 March 2023

It is sad, don't you know, to be living here now
and to know that the runner from Marathon
lost his way, for he founded an empire of thought,
not a tribe of free families, so very Greek was he,
and like no Greek had ever been before... I think Plato
would mind being kin to such savagery, such wars
as turn on their victors, devour them, then reign forever.
This is not Platonic, nor Roman, nor English,
but oh it was Greek, was so very Greek indeed.
