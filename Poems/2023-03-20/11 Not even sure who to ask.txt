Not even sure who to ask
20 March 2023

Even the clock on my HVAC
adjusts itself automatically, like some
divine conspiracy of old, but these
gods of technology want us to
keep life ship shape, want each detail
aligned with some higher design
of pure reason. Whose reason? We ask
now pathetically, not even sure who to ask.
