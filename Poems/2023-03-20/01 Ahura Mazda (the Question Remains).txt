Ahura Mazda (the Question Remains)
20 March 2023

All hail Ahura Mazda, all hail!
Or fall by the Great King's sword!
I am Cyrus, slayer of nations,
and builder of all that remains.
In the name of Ahura Mazda
I rule over Persia, the land of my fathers.
Begrudge not my epitaph. You also
worship Ahura Mazda. If not,
then how do you remain?

The myth of Progress is Ahura Mazda,
The law of money is Ahura Mazda,
The pain of tolerance is Ahura Mazda,
The god of feelings is Ahura Mazda,
Deified sexuality is Ahura Mazda,
New-age bullshit is Ahura Mazda,
The cult of personality if Ahura Mazda,
Democratic Values are Ahura Mazda,
Both you and I are Ahura Mazda, 
or else we could never remain.

Socrates versus Ahura Mazda,
the philosophic struggle against all of Persia
remains undecided, though not for lack of trying.
The question remains whether any accomplishment
stands with finality, or whether any question remains.

I disbelieve you, Ahura Mazda.
No power controls the totality of events.
