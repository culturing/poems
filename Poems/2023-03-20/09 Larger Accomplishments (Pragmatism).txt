Larger Accomplishments (Pragmatism)
20 March 2023

Must they be *true* to be useful, or is it
that laws grease the wheels of society,
giving us form, and through form, giving trust?
Perhaps this is their value, not cosmic obedience
to cosmic justice, but immanent trust in each other
which leads to much larger accomplishments.
