*As She Will
20 March 2023

She grasped my hand, and off we flew
toward a prior world, with gods yet true.
We turned to you, and said Remember
what was said by those lain hundreds dead
before the sun set sadly on the few
who still remained. For here was Greece,
where once a Lady clothed in stone
called forth at Athens for all Greeks,
and here was Ch'in where that same Lady
pulled her maidens to the River.
Know their stories if you dare to live as long as they
and burn forever after, but take care
that you do not become too loyal, for she comes
in many guises, as she will.
