The Realm of Reason
20 March 2023

Have we tired yet of clocks and steamships?
Maybe old Corcyra, maybe Salamis can shake
these rusty bones, but maybe not. This realm
of reason, sacrilegious blend of Greece with Persia,
shall soon end, and maybe then new thoughts of empire
flecked with liberty shall emerge. But is it rather
that Hellenic freedom simply can't be suaged? Apollo
gives his dictates pure, non-partisan, so irony befalls
those who are partial to Apollo. It's a structural
deficiency belying all our thought. Let's think again,
with rightful honor paid to Greece, with due respect
for Cyrus, Xerxes, and with half a glance to China,
just to have a fuller picture.
