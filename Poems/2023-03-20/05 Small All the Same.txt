Small All the Same
20 March 2023

Caught up withal in the most divine madness
we crash through the Phrygian stables
and lather on filth, with such glee
that no shepherd or pen can contain us.

We crash also through all white fences
on main street, or any street -- crash
as those wild as we are who have seen
through the curtain the man at the machine.

What a small man indeed. Shall we triumph,
or are we still small all the same?
