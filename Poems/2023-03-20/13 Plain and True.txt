Plain and True
20 March 2023

I watch them working slowly,
barely knowing how they serve 
the growing tyranny, the urge to please the people,
as in Greece so long ago. They are
no better, when libido dominandi reigns,
as it does reign, in Europe as before. 
But Christian chains could not restrain the beast,
so what hope do we have? Some say
more earthbound hopes, like those of China's past,
to give all dignity, a place upon the stair.
No more enslaving, no more liberty,
but letting dialectic rest in peace.
Give each his duty plain and true.
