After all these years one would have thought
that deleting Facebook would be easier. After all,
it is only a website among many. But strangely pernicious,
its popular draw, even buying and selling turned into
a struggle for approval (to say nothing of genocide).
What is this pull, which determines so much, means
so little. I cannot escape any other way than
the old coward's way, or the nobleman's way
of thick walls. I can still keep it out, have no fear,
but lament that we cannot cooperate. One
would have thought this would be the point,
not to lord my success over others, or over myself
lord successes of others, but rather to speak together,
quietly, under the setting sun. Until Facebook supports this,
I abstain, and expect next to nothing.
