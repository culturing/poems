*If I Can
28 December 2025

These are the harder poems, the darker truths
that must be uttered somewhere. Let me speak,
you say, and I will listen. All I want
is to listen and be informed. But who
are you speaking to? If not to me, some
Authority that has too much sway over you?
I'd like to see you healed, these wounds
covered over by love and time, until
they are barely a memory. This can occur.
All along you have hinted at this, your reality,
but something has brought it more close to home.
I will help you with this if I can.
