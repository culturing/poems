No Matter How Civilized
05 December 2025

Looking back from a posture of wholeness
I see now what I wanted to see, and that
it was always there. It was I who was leaking,
unable to contain the strength of life, unable
to carry that power from day to day. But the power
remains as it is, was, and shall be, forever,
empowering life and our lives, no matter how civilized.
