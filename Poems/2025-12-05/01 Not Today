Not Today
05 December 2025

Enjoy your freedom. It has been well-earned,
and now you are where you belong,
in your own skin, powered by your own soul.
You have been made whole, and now you may wonder
what causes you still to hear *my* name
ride on the wind from time to time.

--

It was time that brought me
and time that brings me away.
I would love to stay, but not today.
