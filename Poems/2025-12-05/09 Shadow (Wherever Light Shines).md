Shadow (Wherever Light Shines)

    <blockquote>
        And so the General of hot desire <br/>
        Was, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarmed.<br/>
        This brand she quenched in a cool well by,<br/>
        Which from Love’s fire took heat perpetual,<br/>
        Growing a bath and healthful remedy,<br/>
        For men diseased; but I, my mistress’ thrall,<br/>
        Came there for cure and this by that I prove,<br/>
        Love’s fire heats water, water cools not love.

Water cools not flame, and yet I am cooled
by some frozen spirit, come again to haunt my dreams.
What do I know? How little is truly revealed!
The way is dark and lonely. I will make a home
and live in it alone.

Who knows the answers more thoroughly
than a madman? Who craves desire
more than a dead man? I fear I have been
mad, or dead, or deadly mad, but this
must be the shadow born from lofty dreams,
inevitable wherever light shines.
