*Blaze
10 February 2026

Not for the first time you have spoken
exactly what I needed to hear. And I had no idea
that I needed to hear it. Consider me amazed.
If you know me so well, I will trust you.
Our sparks are becoming a blaze.

But my criticism stands: we must learn
to speak plainly, as man and woman,
not only as artists, through dreams.
