I walk,  
and keep on walking.  

When I am old,  
will any of what I have seen  
be left standing? Or will it  
be rubble or, worse still, vapor?  
But is that not always  
the fate of life, to vanish?  
I doubt we could make it permanent,  
given that all things are not,  
and yet where does it end?  
In the place it began,  

So I walk,  
and I keep on walking.
