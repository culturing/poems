If tomorrow will be any better
17 August 2025

If I ask myself why,
sneer the answer on the page,
and get rid of it, what good results?
I am rid of it, true, but
the sky and my heart are still blue.
So I am asking you: are you there?
I don't know what good purpose is served
or what hope can endure, but I know
where I stand, as my hand grips the pen
and the page. Shall I rage?
There is nothing deserving of rage.
Shall I moan? This at least fits my mood.
And yet lest I be misunderstood,
let me tell you, tomorrow is coming.
Aye, there I can pin my gaze,
as I navigate all the bent paths of this maze.
But who knows if tomorrow will be any better?
