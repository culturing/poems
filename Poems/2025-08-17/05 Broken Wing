Broken Wing
17 August 2025

It's not enough, is it, these words,
these haunted memories, to tear us from the grip of ghosts?
I have been here before, and I have failed.
Now is no different. So says sober me,
once passion drains away. Not just today,
but always, I abide by rules which
in no heart confided could survive.
It's not enough to sing, not with this broken wing.
