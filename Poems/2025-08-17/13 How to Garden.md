*How to Garden
17 August 2025

I see a beautiful woman
coming into bloom,
but is it too soon to pluck that flower?
If some wild animal comes
and tears at her roots, she will wither and die.
But if the wind blows and carries her
gently into my garden, I will nourish her. 
I have left a place.
And if the wind blows in some other direction,
it's not my concern.
For at least I have seen her.
At least I have learned how to garden.
