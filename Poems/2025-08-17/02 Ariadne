*Ariadne
17 August 2025

Ariadne, weave your thread
around my heart. Invite me
into your labyrinth, and I
will slay countless minotaurs.
But don't be hasty.
Your thread is thin, and bears
not the weight of a strong encounter.
So take my advice.
You must build for yourself
a golden cocoon
through which you'll become what you are.
