*All that could be lost again
17 August 2025

Tug on the string, and watch unravel
the miseries of untold years, the pain
of impossible loves and undying hopes,
the sorrows of things that can't be.
You would like to be free, but I tell you
you must pay a price, not to me,
but to gods that you have not yet known.

They will ask for your heart, and, if given,
will suture your wounds. But the scars
will remain, which, like all scars, bring with them
a certain loss of feeling. It is up to you.
If the pain is too great, you can leave it,
but not without leaving as well much that made life worthwhile.
You may then find new things that make life worthwhile,
but not without irony, not without sardonic laughter
for all that was lost and for all that could be lost again.
