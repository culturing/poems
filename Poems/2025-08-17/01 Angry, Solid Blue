*Angry, Solid Blue
17 August 2025

Who am I really? After all these years
with memories of selves past...am I him,
or him? Each life I have lived flickers by
like the clouds in the sky, in fast motion, a time-lapse,
but none seem true now. Don't be blue, they will say,
but all I can see is the empty expanse of heaven
inviting me to fall *up*, against all gravity.
Who am I really? A protein in one cell of the universe,
or angel song made manifest? Oh, soon, very soon,
we will have to decide, but even these questions
mean little against that angry, solid blue.
And what about you? You must see it too.
