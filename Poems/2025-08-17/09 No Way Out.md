No Way Out
17 August 2025

I stand accused
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in my own heart,
I face the judge
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of my own vanity

And lo, there is no way out.

My heart is tempered,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;true, and yet I 
fear its bouts of madness
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will o'erpower me

And lo, there is no way out.

But love! they say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can temper even madness,
but we know that love
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is madness itself

And lo, there is no way out.
