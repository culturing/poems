*Inexperienced
16 February 2026

Maybe I am the inexperienced one.
You are *woman*, and I will allow you
to show me what that means.

And yet I can dream, can't I,
about what "woman" means? I would be
a poor poet if I did not have such dreams.

An artist must sculpt with precision.
A lover lets blemishes be.
