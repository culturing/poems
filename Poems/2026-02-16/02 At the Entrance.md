At the Entrance
16 February 2026

Perhaps we have rubbed shoulders
at the entrance to the maze of sex,
but I was on my way out,
while you were on your way in.
I cannot dissuade you from entering.
To do so would be folly, and hypocrisy.
But I don't know if I belong there anymore.
Do not let my ramblings confuse or discourage you.
You must follow the course of your heart,
and I must follow mine.
