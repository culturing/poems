Short of a Miracle
07 September 2025

Pain, pain of the deepest kind,
but also a slow resolve
to put forward what might have a place
in my solitary world.

With these banners unfurled, I ignite
all my yesterdays, watching the conflagration
consume pain and hope alike.

Is the tragedy that I can't love
or that none can love me?

I believe I have learned how to love.
I believe I am able.

But finding another to stand beside me
and watch these banners burn
will prove more than difficult.

It will prove impossible, short of a miracle.
