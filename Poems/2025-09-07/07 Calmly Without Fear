*Calmly Without Fear
07 September 2025

Wash me clean, O waters of Lethe,
and fill me with the power of forgetting.
It is but a moment we traverse here,
on our way to forever, but you, sweet waters,
are the needed salve, the balm to make all memories
(yes, even those of Lenore) *disappear*.
It has been done and must be done with proper care,
lest darkness conquer all, but with a bit of force
all is made new. And as for you, be true,
but do not cling too long to truth, because these waters
beckon calmly without fear.
