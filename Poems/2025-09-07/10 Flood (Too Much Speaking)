*Flood (Too Much Speaking)
07 September 2025

Rains fall so heavy, lightning,
thunder answer, what is to be left of us,
what remains when all things age
and time washes away
the ink and blood on the page?
Are any left who know
how to find ground, where feet
may rest, what drives the body
to exhaustion, time after time?
This is the beginning, another flood
to cleanse the palate of God,
to wet his lips and throat
after too much speaking.

Only by forgetting
can we remember
what is most important.

Only by forgetting
can we come home.
