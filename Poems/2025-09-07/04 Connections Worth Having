Connections Worth Having
07 September 2025

Cool winds blow, the sun shines,
and I wonder whatever could inhabit such minds
that they cannot acknowledge an olive branch
even with a simple refusal.

Do I so scare them
that silence becomes required?

Or can their own inner conflict
not be put into words?

Or was something said, but said quietly,
in some way that I could not hear?

I will never know.

So all I can do is *be me*,
for no other path
leads to connections worth having.
