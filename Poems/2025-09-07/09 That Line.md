That Line
07 September 2025

<small><em>I've never been one who likes to trespass,
but sometimes you just</em> find <em>yourself over the line</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Bob Dylan, *Brownsville Girl*</small>

Where was that line? And how silly
to cross or not cross...and what spirit
transported me...into another me?
