Nothing Changes
07 September 2025

Nothing has changed.
Time goes on, but I
stay what I always was.
It's a miracle
that I have survived
nature's practical jokes,
that its tricks do not
do me in, given what we are.
But love stays out of reach
for those whose inner worlds
are unwelcome.
There is no cure,
and nothing will change,
but time still goes on.
