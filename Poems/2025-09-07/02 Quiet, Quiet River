*Quiet, Quiet River
07 September 2025

The river is quiet today, and I
would like to walk beside it,
asking many questions of its life.

Is Love the answer,
or is Love the question?

I have seen sad faces turn,
transformed by hope into glorious forms,
and I have seen this same hope die
time after time.

The river is quiet, and I
would like to be like it,
but I cannot quite escape the pull
of destiny, which calls to me,

And says: you are not alone.
We are all broken-hearted.

And yet my heart breaks
in unusual ways,

and whatever the Gospel says,
it cannot heal my wounds.

But this river, this quiet, quiet river,
has germs of a quiet salvation
that has no need to be shared.

I will walk beside it
and drink from it time after time.
