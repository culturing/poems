The Path of an Insect
13 January 2026

My heart has grabbed the wheel and said,
"Mind, sit down, you are not master here."
You ask if I'm sure. I am thoroughly baffled
and utterly confused but still totally motivated
to see this through. My certainty and uncertainty
are no more relevant than the path of an insect.
I go where I must go. This is the way.
