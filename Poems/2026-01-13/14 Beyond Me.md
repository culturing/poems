*Beyond Me
13 January 2026

I have caught sight of a future with you in it,
although the surrounding environs are blurred. Would we love
as lovers forever, or would we transform into parents?
I think I can handle either and have a strong preference
for both as opposed to a future without you. Am I mad
to speak thus to a woman I hardly know? No, I do not feel mad,
and I think my heart *does* know, though how it can know
I don't know (it's beyond me). Still, we must take our time, 
and unravel this new dilemma, exposing illusions 
'til only solid things remain.
