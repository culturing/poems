Two Together
13 January 2026

Two together, wishing no other fate,
even as time ravages body and mind...
When we no longer remember
what we stood up to do, we will still
remember this time, when we met
and combined, and that fire will burn
even as all other fires wane. This I claim
as a hope and a prophecy, knowing of course
not for sure, not as matters of logic
pretend to be sure, but as one of the heart's imperatives,
saying "go." And so I will go, and make it so.
