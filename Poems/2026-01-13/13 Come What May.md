*Come What May
13 January 2026

Even in paradise, one can find doubts, and these doubts
form an image of how many futures the present could become.
There are no guarantees. There are many ways to answer desire,
some better than others, but none that ensure a result.
The assurance is that the attempt is made, come what may.
