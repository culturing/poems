Not Without Fuel
13 January 2026

Some loves are like fireworks: big and explosive,
exciting but quickly over, leaving a desolate sky behind.
We must not be like this, not if we can help it.
There is a better way, more grounded, keeping the fire
in a hearth where it belongs. We can let it burn, of course,
but not carelessly, not without tending, and not without fuel.
