*Regular Release
13 January 2026

Can you heal the dark part of me, the deviant part
that would have many women, and not have them for long?
There's no question that such love is empty, and yet
if my body is master, it says to love many, not one.
Why have concubines always attended the powerful?
Are there two kinds of love, the better for wives
made permanent, the worse for disposable women, however
disgusting we find it? Where does this "love" come from, ubiquitous
and yet still shameful? The body cannot be controlled,
not completely, though we wish it could...
Who's to say whether even the greatest love
can overcome a man's need for release, on a regular cadence
defined by the gods?
