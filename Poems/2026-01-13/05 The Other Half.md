*The Other Half
13 January 2026

I have no trouble imagining being with you.
It feels like returning to the most familiar totem,
the dream of familiarity punctuated by bursts
of reality, making us laugh. We are real too, you know,
even with all desires swept normally undertow
at last opened, revealed, exposed. It would be
like the sweetest retreat into love that this world can know.
It would be dreams come true at last,
a so long to the past and a door to the future.
So sweet dreams, my love, but remember
that words are but half of my offer.
The other half waits for your answer.
