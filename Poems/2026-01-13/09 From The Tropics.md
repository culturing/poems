From The Tropics
13 January 2026

Greetings from the tropics, where love grows
like foliage, dense and inescapable. Ocean breezes
blow across this wide array of thoughts, and bring them
warmth, ensured by the equatorial sun. I'm only passing through,
and all my thoughts return to you and my deepest wish,
that you were here. For now I'll sit here sipping rum
and feel at ease, but if it please you, please consider
whether you would like to join me here next time.
I'd like that very much.
