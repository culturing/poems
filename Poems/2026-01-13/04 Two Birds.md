*Two Birds
13 January 2026

I want you to think hard about what has happened
and then decide. I want you to know what you're doing.
It may be that love is blind. It may be
that we are two birds of a different kind, with clashing songs.

But even as I write this line, two birds emerge
from the foliage, water birds, tropical and at ease.
It's like nature is talking to me, as they glide on the breeze
over Magens Bay, saying: two become one in all places,
all times, and in every locale...and your time is now.
