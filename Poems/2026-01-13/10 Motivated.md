*Motivated
13 January 2026

I've never been this motivated before. You've gotten
under my skin, and I like you there, as a constant reminder
of what it means to love and be loved in return. You will say
you have *not* loved...of course this is true in the mundane realm,
but the astral realm pulses with love (from you?) sent in my direction.
How can I ignore it? But the choice is yours forever, to love
or not love, for the love that I want can't be taken,
it can only be given, freely, and if you are not yet free,
I will wait and see, for this love you have brewing
may be just what I've always needed.
