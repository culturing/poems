There is too much noise  
inside, between walls,  
reverberating through skulls  

Which grow empty.  

Is there not solace, rest  
from Self?  

Is there a balm?  

I have heard of places,  
heard tunes of theogony,  
but is there any calm?  

What remains are ashes,  
What remains are gems?  

And must we know the difference?  

I've yet to stumble through Eden  
but I've heard her song,  
I’ve seen blossoms rise.  

If there is a balm  
it lies behind still-naked eyes.
