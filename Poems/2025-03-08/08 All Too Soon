*All Too Soon
08 March 2025

Observe the winds of change, but do not bow.
You are here anyhow, where things can change
and where we must make choices, yes and no.
It is *your* time to go, and yet you do not know
what happens next. I beg of you please with respect
do not tarry forever or plan every inch of your kingdom,
but go and be baptized by fire, as some were before,
and take heart, and take action, and burn what is rotten,
but leave root and stem that the plant may regrow,
for the next harvest comes all too soon.
