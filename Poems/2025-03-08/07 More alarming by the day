*More alarming by the day
08 March 2025

Who is to answer them, the critics
without a direction, the spineless destroyers,
the miserable seeking company? Not more like them,
not their progeny, not those in chains, but the free.
We have made all men free, so we say,
but it has not gone well, or at least
it has been a mixed blessing, where most cling to freedom
as devotees, as fervent and small-minded as any peasant,
and who is to sing to or for them?
Such a soul is not a place for song,
being wracked with uncertainty and crushed by the burden
of thinking through things on its own. Why despair?
Even that is unhelpful, when men have been made
more than useless by systems, demands, institutions
that expect them to doubt what they are, although
at the same time, to belong is in fact what they are.
They are drawn to the group by instinct, but these groups
proceed to destroy the group instinct. So what can we say?
There is nothing to say, one would like to pass by,
but this power becomes more alarming day by day.
