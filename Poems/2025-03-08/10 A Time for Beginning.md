A Time for Beginning
08 March 2025

If there was ever a time for beginning, it's now,
in the cool embrace of both past and future, holding firmly
the hands of both, in between what has been and will be.
But this now, at this moment, is specially charged
with an urgent decision, to moor to the shores of a recent past
or cast off into waters unknown. But those waters have been known before
by some like us, and some came out better for knowing.
Are we so accustomed to Progress and all its accoutrements
that we grow too fat to endure? Or are we so hasty to abandon
the ways of our fathers that no sacred temple shall stand?
It is both, and neither. It is time to begin
the assembly of the future, but keeping in mind
the successes as well as the failures of those who came before.
