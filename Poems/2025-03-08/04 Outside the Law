*Outside the Law
08 March 2025

Who would have guessed
that another dawn comes,
even for us? Yet it comes
as we wander from day to day
like the children we are in the morning,
when life is too bright and we shield our eyes
lest they burn out, as has happened
to those who were here before. In that dawn,
I stand ready to embrace the new spirit,
for the blind have at times made good poets,
and I feel likewise aligned with the tides
of those minds that can linger over all
the minutia that others pass by, and thereby
can derive at their leisure some new eyes
for a new kind of pride for mankind.

But you know none can do it alone, and it's true
that belief is the glue that combines us, even those
found untrue, but for me, as for you, the delay
between my needs and the will of the group forces
solitude, and I would just like to invite you to join me
outside of the Law of Rome, where the spirit can grow
to fill needs and then test the waters apart
from any pre-ordained Plan. Yes, there's life there,
and lots of it, but we who have broken our chains
now stand dumbstruck, unsure how to build or produce order
without simply rechaining others, as well as ourselves,
with the shackles of Law run amok (even making
chainbreaking its own kind of law!) I would like
to remind you: think harder. Our children depend on it.
