Think Harder
08 March 2025

I invite you to think again
your own thoughts, not the echoes of others.
I invite you to be that much human,
for although most do not do such thinking
the few that do earn a place for mankind
among stars, in the nebulae of wonders
that nature produces. So, please, go on thinking,
to your mind's content, ere the rabble return
from whatever destruction they've dreamed up today.
But think harder for them, with some pity,
for they did not make their own natures
and you did not make yours.
