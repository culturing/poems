New Hearts
08 March 2025

Who will remember us? We,
doom-scarred and battle-stricken
who never initiated the mysteries of procreation
but still create in other ways, 
through song? It is at least a hundred years until
our names be lost, our property divided or destroyed
though words live on, not just on paper or on screens
but in new hearts.
