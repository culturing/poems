The bulldozers are out today,  
are blazing in what once was forest.  
  
I was in this forest  
as a child.  
  
Do the workers know  
the sound of crickets here  
within leaves, the sound   
of song that matches oversong?  
  
I am not sentimental,  
for I know it to be earth   
becoming earth,  
and yet I wonder what earth is,  
  
Because the poets ask, and keep on asking,  
though they cannot answer,  
for we find the question worthy.  
  
Something in the wind   
this time of year  
must stir uncertainty.  
  
What shall we ask the bulldozer?  
What does it know?
