Back to the Mines
15 December 2022

I think sometimes we shall never escape
from the general, all-around clusterfuck
(pardon the language, it applies) of humanity
always and everywhere, in general confused
about what it all means, about what *meaning* means,
or why meaning is so indispensable.

Oh well, let's back to the mines
for another long spell of formation through labor.
