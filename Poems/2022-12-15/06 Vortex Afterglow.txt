Vortex Afterglow
15 December 2022

In the afterglow of the morning, I walked
to the edge of a growing circumference, never in doubt,
not resolved, but still present, like one from another room,
and I saw there before me an image, but what
it portended no words can express. Yet it took me by eye
and led into the nearest horizon, that place where
the shadows have form and vice versa, and there I saw
only my dreams of tomorrow, a fantasy littered with
chaos and rhyme. There the sun never set, but stayed
stuck in its setting, a sculpture one mis-takes for living.
Soon after the journey reminded of home, so alone
I walked backwards, until stretched by hands unlike mine
through the vortex of time to beginnings, as well as 
to ends, before all as my witnesses ready to go and to find.
