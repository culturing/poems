You Are The Way
15 December 2022

Listen to me. Listen (I will speak) to this beginning
out of no-thing (yet not nothing). There no more shall be
interminable deductions from infallible first principles, not even
if those principles be liberal. We are all that's left, my friend.
The way is you, my friend from afar. You are the way to me.
