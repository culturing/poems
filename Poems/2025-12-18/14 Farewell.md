*Farewell
18 December 2025

Farewell, my love. I have dreamed you
a better dream, but it seems
that for you and for me a chasm grows,
an impassable sea, that cuts off any chance
of love. But the chasm stares back into me,
and the longer I look, the darker we both become.
We had only begun, but this ending is sweet
with a bittersweet knowledge, that some loves last
while others merely make us better lovers.
So go and be better.
Farewell. Farewell. Farewell.
