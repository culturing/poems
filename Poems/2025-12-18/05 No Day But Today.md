The masks come off, and all is revealed
as macabre somnambulance, dreaming vexed
to nightmare, hope turned sour, and no other choice
than to move on. Is this so? I don't know.
Love is fickle, alas, especially when single-handed.
It's never too late, I suppose, but of course
this contradicts my experience. Every past love
has become a closed door. What's one more?
I will add a new key to my keyring
and keep this place locked away.
If not today...if not today...
then not any day. There is
no day but today.
