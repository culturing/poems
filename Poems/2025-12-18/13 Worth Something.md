Worth Something
18 December 2025

It has had a long gestation, but now
it's out there, so let me slip in
one last piece of advice: do not just
give yourself away. You know better. Endeavor
for love, lasting love, the true kind,
or at least a short love that transforms.
If it has to be brief, make it worth something.
