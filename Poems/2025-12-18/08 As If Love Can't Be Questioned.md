As If Love Can't Be Questioned
18 December 2025

I know the way. The night is dark, but my eyes
see just fine under these conditions. It's not as if
love can't be questioned or put in its place,
as if all bows to love and all powers of reason dissolve.
This was always a foolish delusion, one worthy of little comment.
