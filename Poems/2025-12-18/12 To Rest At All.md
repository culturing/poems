To Rest At All
18 December 2025

I have said what I needed to say, and now
I can rest for the rest of the day, but the night
comes on quickly and chases away what remains.
What a curious life. There's no answer, just questions,
so many terrible questions that trouble my restless heart.
From the start I am restless and never find rest,
'til I play my part in the crazy maneuvering of gods.
Can they forgive me? Can you? For what I'm not sure,
but there is no cure for this surplus of insight. I must
put out the light to rest at all.
