Starting Again
18 December 2025

Soothe me, gentle spirit, goddess of flame...
I don't know your name, but I know your face,
with those eyes that see past my disguises, so I can revel
with masks on or off as my fancy chooses.
There is a deep well full of healing waters,
a hot spring where hope burns eternal, on top of the mountain
of beginnings, where travelers come at the end
to get rest before starting again.
