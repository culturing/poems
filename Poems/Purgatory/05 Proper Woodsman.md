Proper Woodsman
12 January 2024

I am writing to tell you a secret,
learned time and again by all lovers,
that lies serve to fertilize women,
and men have their gardens to tend.
There will be no escaping it, for if you do
dare engage, you will find no more truth,
no more clarity, working for love as your wage,
and your love, ever growing, a comfort through life
and old age, will replace even Truth
in life's page of goods. But thus lost
in love's woods, who can say whether one
is less happy than he, proper woodsman,
who lives on his own by the stream
and cuts down all the trees in between
his broad window and Town, seeing clearly
the coming of storms, and how dusk seems to fall
right on time, every time? If you need
clear advice, search for him, but do not be surprised
if he says that the thing you love most
is the cause of the pain your abhor.
"Close the door," he will say, "for you let dark things in.
I have spoken. Now be on your way."
