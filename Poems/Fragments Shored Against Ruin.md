#### 1

You are the last fighting chance   
for yourself,

A chamber, a kingdom   
-- *Cordelia!*

*Where is the throne?*   
*What is flesh?*

A clock in the hall   
A clock and no walls

And spinning   
Rome is burning

*Tick Tick Tick* --

There are things that move the will   
that even the atom cannot kill --

*There are things there are things*

-- If you do not control yourself,   
who will?

The executive has surrendered   
all -- anarchy ensues.

The state in which one cannot say no,  
when one cannot stop,  
is called chaos today is chaos  
and we are revolving in kaleidoscope  
houses that looked fun

who am the last fighting chance  
for myself, the only opportunity  
to be free of that doggerel wretch  
who sits on the mind-throne

while, usurped, the executive wastes  
in heaps of sentiment and flesh  
that wash over all  
and bathe with the lime of body.

soma. soma soma soma  
take and live.

My body waffling through space   
and undigested time conceives   
Idea -- floats, as it were, above itself   
into ethereal otherlands

and waits.

Up, from where is only down,   
I fly, and divide this self   
into slivers, abandoning each   
at the foot of age-old Mind

Who takes them, warping tomorrow   
with hands of iron, cold. 

I am left unanswered.

#### 4

I fear the smallness of my mind   
surrounded by mysteries,

The abstract cave,   
philosopher's chains   
unbroken,

Bound,   
and sinking down.

And are there here no sunbeams,   
no exalted forms that dance   
on more than cavewall?

#### 5

There are no tunes or strings to play   
unbloodied by the rage, unbridled   
by fearful faces, names   
turned dusty with shame.

How far the sky has fallen,   
how far! deep within our bowels

We cannot digest   
or swallow.

There is only us -- only the rage   
and the cold, swollen cage.   
The bruised age.

#### 6

Listen. We will begin   
to repeal soporifics   
only in the light of more pure   
harmonies and form.

There can be no freedom in extravagance.

Love is the beginning but not the fruition,   
which comes only through discipline   
and a kind of violence.

Once we have established ourselves   
at the end of ourselves, and only then,   
can we draw from the ashes   
some kind of beginning.

#### 7

Is there still a Song,   
and can I sing along?

This man, boy, heart beating hard and strong,   
'tis mine? And may I be wrong?

I have wallowed verily, wallowed long   
in the avenues and twisting ways   
of ecstasy and sorrow,

But there is forthcoming joy,   
awakened noise which learns to balance   
and to hope with poise

The truth of which   
is There is There is There.
