### Fragments Shored Against Ruin 

#### 1

You are the last fighting chance \
for yourself,

A chamber, a kingdom \
-- *Cordelia!*

*Where is the throne?* \
*What is flesh?*

A clock in the hall \
A clock and no walls

And spinning \
Rome is burning

*Tick Tick Tick* --

There are things that move the will \
that even the atom cannot kill --

*There are things there are things*

-- If you do not control yourself, \
who will?

#### 2

The executive has surrendered \
all -- anarchy ensues.

The state in which one cannot say no,\
when one cannot stop,\
is called chaos today is chaos\
and we are revolving in kaleidoscope\
houses that looked fun

who am the last fighting chance\
for myself, the only opportunity\
to be free of that doggerel wretch\
who sits on the mind-throne

while, usurped, the executive wastes\
in heaps of sentiment and flesh\
that wash over all\
and bathe with the lime of body.

soma. soma soma soma\
take and live.

#### 3

My body waffling through space \
and undigested time conceives \
Idea -- floats, as it were, above itself \
into ethereal otherlands

and waits.

Up, from where is only down, \
I fly, and divide this self \
into slivers, abandoning each \
at the foot of age-old Mind

Who takes them, warping tomorrow \
with hands of iron, cold. 

I am left unanswered.

#### 4

I fear the smallness of my mind \
surrounded by mysteries,

The abstract cave, \
philosopher's chains \
unbroken,

Bound, \
and sinking down.

And are there here no sunbeams, \
no exalted forms that dance \
on more than cavewall?

#### 5

There are no tunes or strings to play \
unbloodied by the rage, unbridled \
by fearful faces, names \
turned dusty with shame.

How far the sky has fallen, \
how far! deep within our bowels

We cannot digest \
or swallow.

There is only us -- only the rage \
and the cold, swollen cage. \
The bruised age.

#### 6

Listen. We will begin \
to repeal soporifics \
only in the light of more pure \
harmonies and form.

There can be no freedom in extravagance.

Love is the beginning but not the fruition, \
which comes only through discipline \
and a kind of violence.

Once we have established ourselves \
at the end of ourselves, and only then, \
can we draw from the ashes \
some kind of beginning.

#### 7

Is there still a Song, \
and can I sing along?

This man, boy, heart beating hard and strong, \
'tis mine? And may I be wrong?

I have wallowed verily, wallowed long \
in the avenues and twisting ways \
of ecstasy and sorrow,

But there is forthcoming joy, \
awakened noise which learns to balance \
and to hope with poise

The truth of which \
*is There is There is There.*
