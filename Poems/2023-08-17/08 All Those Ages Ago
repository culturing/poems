*All Those Ages Ago
17 August 2023

What was the point of it all,
the mad dash for adulthood, the scramble
for something just over the next hill?
We are here now, they tell us, but where
and when, who can say? After all
we are malleable still, in the flux
as before, although firmer somehow,
but not rigid. No, we are the end of the dream
that began when our first parents met
all those ages ago.
