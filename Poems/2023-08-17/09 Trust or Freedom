Trust or Freedom
17 August 2023

We can either have trust or freedom,
but they are opposed and cannot coexist.
We have gambled on freedom, but
whether we're happy remains to be seen.
Whether happiness can be found anywhere
also remains to be seen. But perhaps
just a little more trust would leaven the dough.
