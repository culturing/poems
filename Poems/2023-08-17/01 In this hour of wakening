In this hour of wakening, what spirit comes
to revive even these cold remains? What revival
awaits even these mossy chains? Is the sun
to be trusted, or must we learn echolocation?
I've little to gain by remaining unnamed, 
except freedom, most untrusty boon, but the path
to formation is wrought with the trials of the hero.
