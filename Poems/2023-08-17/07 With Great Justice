*With Great Justice
17 August 2023

We were a people that never did wish to be led,
having known all too well where paths lead and how
leaders betray every confidence, sure as we were
that negation was what kept things moving, we struggled
to keep ourselves firm. But the sun always set
of its own accord, unconcerned with our struggles
and even providing false hope for a world ruled 
by cosmic order. Such hopes were a threat to the struggle
and, therefore, ourselves, bent on instituting tyranny
of various kinds. Oh how surely we knew what we knew,
having mastered all lessons without even studying,
graced as we must have been with inhuman strength.
But a few in the wilderness still kept their tablets of stone,
saying these, or if not, some like these, will one day
restore order in a barren land, because savagery
brings nothing new, but instead brings to rubble
the works of a thousand years. The new order,
whatever its form, will arise, and decay, and fall.
After all, we are left where we started,
both wary of leaders and craving them, both,
it would seem, with great justice.
