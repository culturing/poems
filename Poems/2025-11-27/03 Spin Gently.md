Spin Gently
27 November 2025

Where does she go? Into what place,
what hidden land, to sort out herself
and discover who she really is? It is strange
how one turns and becomes another, and stranger
how love plays a role, as the catalyst,
turning us all in our turn. So spin gently,
my love, to avoid getting sick.
I'll be waiting here when you have finished.
