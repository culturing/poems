*Sense of the Darkness
27 November 2025

She waits by the window, wonders
whether to call, and wishes she knew
what she's waiting for. Out there the night moves,
and she is accustomed to steady lights
that cut through the darkness and leave it for dead.
Is there holiness out there too? Something sacred
that pulses through throbbing veins and in every rude thrust
of male upon female? She wonders, and slowly
her eyes adjust. She begins to make sense of the darkness.
