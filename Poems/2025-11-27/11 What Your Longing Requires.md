*What Your Longing Requires
27 November 2025

Only give me a sign that it's safe to approach,
and I'll light up your sky with new stars,
I'll envelop your doubts in the tides of love,
pulled by the new moon. This would be no dream
but reality, quelled from its wildness of forms
into hope eternal, the steady flame of an earnest love.
All of this can be yours, as you know, yet
you hesitate, pausing perhaps one last time
at the doorway of childhood, where some early love
leaves you cold. It has been foretold 
that you rise and become what your longing requires.
You will not forever be burdened by unmet desires.
