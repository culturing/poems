Extended Silence
27 November 2025

Ambivalence comes and nestles
under the firmament, deep in my heart,
where a dream still lives but wanes.

I know of the perfect role for you.
In fact you were born to play it.

But will you play it? Why do you retreat?
Is another role calling, a callback to childhood perhaps
where some unfinished business lingers?

I will hold this part open for you,
but not forever. Only until you have answered,
and even extended silence would serve as an answer.
