*What Your Desire Is For
27 November 2025

You wore it too soon, before any decision
had been reached or negotiations commenced.
You were eager but also aware
that your eagerness may have spelled danger.
The ring was a symbol of desire but also
a hermetic seal enclosing that desire,
preventing unauthorized growths taking root
in your soul. But these growths are the thing itself.
They are what your desire is for.
