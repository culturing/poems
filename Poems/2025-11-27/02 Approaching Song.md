Approaching Song
27 November 2025

It was always a matter of life and death,
that much I can understand. But the truth of the matter
was left unrevealed in a miscarriage of love.
The clock stops and all faces turn to hear the music pause.
A strange silence ensues, and for only a moment I think I can hear
the low rumble of approaching song.
