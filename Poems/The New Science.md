The New Science
06 April 2017

Under the stars a hundred bards
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drop still, dead silent,
to look for a law in the cards.

They know the stomach is violent,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a flame that retards,

And also that men have bodies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are bodies, whirling
in an endless whirl of leaves.

Therefore they crucify Reason,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that cold Inspector
who murders the seasons,

And go on unvarnished
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but do not think 
that makes them tarnished.

Can we place blame 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for this treason?

Might it be just 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that in spite of stars
Man hasn't come that far?
