*All as One
12 June 2024

What is to become of it,
the whirling gears of time
being what they are, and they,
or it (there being no difference),
aswirl together as if as One?
I do not doubt it, though
I question whence doubt comes
and whither any go who doubt
and thus hold firm. To some
cool purgatory perhaps, but
when the empires fall, when God
appears, when All casts off her veil
revealing Night, what will become
of us, the time-bound, who held doubt
as though a totem that could save?
