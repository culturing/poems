*Good Enough
12 June 2024

What did I want from her anyway?
Some affirmation? Maybe a thrill?
I know this: looks can kill,
but not words, which bring order
to those things that lack it.
I am not alone with my many selves,
so what role had she, if not merely
Intruder? Yet some sadness lingers
like a man defeated, and I must be
with the birds and the trees, for whom
I am good enough, 'til it passes,
and all the black mourners at all the black masses
never can lift this one pall, that I lack
what a woman needs, not by my fault
but by nature, and so I must seek 
that of nature which does not offend.
