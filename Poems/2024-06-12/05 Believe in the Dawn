Believe in the Dawn
12 June 2024

In the twilight there's Caesar Augustus,
who brought in the Pax Romana,
becoming its sovereign, supreme over all.
But what violence lies behind every peace
we have learned. In that time we
have also discovered ourselves (go figure)
and now we shall never forget that all laws
are manmade, and can be manunmade
as required. When is it required? We know
of a few examples, no more. In the twilight,
we reach for a candle, but stumble,
take heart, and believe in the dawn.
