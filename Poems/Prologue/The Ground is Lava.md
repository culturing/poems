The Ground is Lava
31 August 2022

Late one morning, I ventured
to know myself, like the thinkers demand, 
but before I had gone through the threshold, 
I saw that the ground had returned to primordial soup.
As I gazed at that chaos, I thought of how children 
pretend that the ground becomes lava. 
How wise they are, unlike ourselves,
who pretend that foundations are solid
in order that we might erect some grand edifice.
Children know well that foundations are fluid, 
and that we just do what we can.
Ask the children how much they believe,
or, importantly, *why* they believe.
I suspect they have far purer reasons.
