The bigness of the sky
04 August 2016

See that thing above us,
floating here and everywhere?

Wonder if one tumbled up
and never came back down.

Fear the fat foot-fallen
finding roots for flesh and soul.

Hear what coaxes upward
and what promises the rest.

Think perhaps that atmosphere
is lofty and above.

Find a reconciliation,
some true thing to truly love.
