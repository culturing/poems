*Lincoln's Memory
29 August 2019

So favored forms of power 
shall not perish from the earth, 
would you please sing for us, O History, 
about the urgent birth 
of these great, terrible, united States, 
which, though conceived in Liberty, 
did break, some say, that vow?

This nation under God, twice founded, 
ever failing, yet immortal, 
did embark toward the dream of Freedom 
led by that one stout Kentuckian 
who hated much as loved 
and took a promise unfulfilled 
and made it law to bind on all.

This promise, called Equality, 
our hope in days to come, 
arose, O History! through violence, 
and herein lies its song.

--

Twas eighteen-fifty-eight, whereon a Senate seat contended 
led the folks of Illinois to dream they saw a President. 
One Lincoln-not-yet-Deity, preparing for debate, 
stood by a portrait of old Jefferson, to whom he could relate, 
and said,

"Old predecessor tongue with wings, remind me, 
whence came our brave truth, 
that all men are created equal. 
Knew you this in youth?"

To which the painting said, 
"It was a growth of many years, 
first born on England's hills 
in faithful regicide."

And Lincoln asked, 
"But had you heard of man's first disobedience 
and the fruit?"

Came quick reply: 
"Our Massachusetts friends knew of such things, 
but I did hope to purge all superstition, 
and robe God in Nature."

"Ah, in nature," Lincoln said.

"That's right. For all can become noble 
if they're only left alone."

Great Lincoln, growing ponderous, 
stroked his chin 
and paced before the painting, 
murmuring, "If left alone…"

He did not dare to broach the question, 
burned on his and other minds, 
of Slavery, but rather urged this thought: 
"Suppose we find all men not equal. Who's at fault?"

But there was no reply.

The painting would not speak, 
and Lincoln found his affirmation.

As the sureness grew, 
he pondered long 
and nursed a budding song.

--

This Lincoln after many years 
appeared before the dead 
and spoke the words 
we will not long remember,

for we must not hallow, 
must not consecrate that ground 
where many died and killed.

Thus Lincoln willed, 
and thus we must obey.

--

But Oh, how Declaration 
had sent shocks across the sea 
as Mr. Jefferson endeavored 
to give ground to that new plea 
which was come forth just then, 
at last!

And when ‘twas time for tea in Boston, 
there was Paine in every head, 
and ‘twas ideas, sir, ideas! 
which would leave so many dead.

--

Lord, such war and terror 
bled from North down through the South 
until the only ones remaining 
banished God and punished doubt.

To devastation wrought, 
and to the horror not quite heeded,

To man's ultimate obedience, 
friend History, give song.
