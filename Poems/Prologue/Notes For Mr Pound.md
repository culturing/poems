Notes for Mr. Pound
22 September 2016

Ezra, you've gathered the fundaments.
This is how they cohere:

Consider the blackbird singing,
just one, not yet perturbed
and yet disturbed by something
somehow, into song --

How singest thou?

Still I sing along, I too must sing
because your song is ours
and we have sung it long:

A song of walls and boundaries
and chains defying reason,
giving Form a bad name.

But peeping o'er the maze I see
a light which answers praise.
