The Lady Speaks of Progress
03 August 2019

*For Langston Hughes*

I have known progress.
My soul has grown weak just for progress.

I have known progress from London to New Orleans,
and my soul has grown weak just for progress.

I have walked out at night among men without bones,
and my soul had grown weak just for progress.

I have ridden in cars and smoked,
and found God to find myself revoked,
and I have known all the dark secrets that you would swear you would never invoke.

And my soul has grown weak just for progress.

I am not now nor will I ever be
the kind of lady who belongs by making family,
because my soul is weak.

My soul has grown weak just for progress.

And oh, I have machines, 
and shiny things,
but they don’t speak.

And oh, my soul, why are you so weak?
Is there nothing new to seek?
Speak. The men
have not fathomed your needs.
