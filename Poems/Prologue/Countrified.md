Countrified
06 April 2017

I have heard the wail of cities,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have felt their steely cry,
And I have prowled upon the pavement
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And been burned from eye to eye.

I cannot hate the people
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who have known no other way,
But I don't think their crippling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must darken my own day.
