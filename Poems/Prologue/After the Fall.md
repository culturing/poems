After the Fall
28 October 2016

I dislike Rome
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(he whispered 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to no one in particular),

Her dead-head poets,
her worldliness,

But then I am a Platonist,
who finds no 
succor colliding
επιθυμια with time.

What Good are monuments?
All of them fall.

No, no, no Godot,
no Reason,

But I make with you,

and sing a nascent treason.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that true?
