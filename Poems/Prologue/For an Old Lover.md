*For an Old Lover
06 August 2016

I held you in a dream-worn land
and felt upon this hand
a subtle war that ne'er was sparked by man
but burned in this mind's eye.

Surer forms of idol worship 
walk just like a woman, but are tenderer,
and spirit us forgotten things,
and give us ghostly wings.

Lover, you know beauty flies.
Enclose again within my soul
that morsel of eternal grace
you burned in this mind’s eye.
