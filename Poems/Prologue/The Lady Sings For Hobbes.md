The Lady Sings for Hobbes
22 July 2019

What sayest thou, clear thinker,
about friendship? 

Have you cherished love?

Though Power, yes, is sought
(there is no doubt), is every motion
just a chasing after clout?

What would your mother think?

I do not speak for her
or for myself,
but for the Lady,

who has sent me 
to remind you who you are.
