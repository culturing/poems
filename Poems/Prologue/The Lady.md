*The Lady
06 May 2019

I dreamed I saw a Lady
perched atop a milk-white stair,
overlooking starry oceans
and defining what was there.

Beneath her golden tresses
opened up a gnawing void,
which catapulted us to freedom.
Soon all motion was destroyed!

The Lady did not stir, but crooned,
and smiled a softer smile
than wisest men have dared to dream.
Then she turned her back awhile.

The void kept belching fire,
and the only thing we knew
was its bedevilment and whirl.
It proved that all things are see-through!

The Lady meanwhile, laughing,
stayed atop of how things are,
and by the time we knew what hit us,
saw we hadn’t gotten far.

The morning came as always,
and we, naked on her shore,
cried out, “Dear Lady, let us near!
Your sweet forgiveness, we implore!”

She looked at all our nakedness,
saw through our praise and plight,
and said, “Fools, get yourselves together,
or else get out of my sight!”
