*Valediction to Images
06 August 2016

Image of forgotten beauty,
Face of fire, flesh of music,
Laughter-loving Aphrodite,
Be not high or mighty
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the altar of my heart.

Rosy cheeks on satin faces,
Eyes that call the heart to race, 
O, sculpture of amazing graces,
Shatter. There are empty places
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep within my heart.

Come instead, you hidden song,
You dying fall withholding all,
And I will hear you long,
For I can hear you call 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From deep within the altar of my heart.
