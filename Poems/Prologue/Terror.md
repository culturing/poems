Terror
11 September 2018

Planes, flames, wreckage.

Images played, replayed
in certain ways.

Oh, the horror.

News inspires
*terror terror acts of terror
terrorist muslim extremist
terror*

all day long,
even though there are children.

—

Loyalty is not at all times virtuous,
but neither is disloyalty.

Either keeps things moving.

For those who have known terror,
what of love?

Can such things be?

—

I hear the Bush
in the wilderness,
burning,

Take off my shoes
and wait.

It cannot speak.

And this will not be easy.
We must live with ourselves.

—

But one may ask,
what *is* treason?

And more than one may answer.

And we have been like this,
and with good reason,
but we will not dwell on that now.

—

I fear the Bush has burnt,
and we are alone.

But then a cry comes from the desert,

“Keep those embers burning!
Night is coming!
It is growing colder!”

And I wonder without wonder
when the world would rather freeze.
