As I Wander
22 October 2010

As I wander down this path
I face my friend my fear, 
and gaze upon the fading footsteps
that I followed here.

I find my heart quite trodden down
and no tranquility.
I find I’m not who I have been
I find I cannot see.

I gaze at beauty all around
but nothing moves my soul.
Backward forward endlessly, 
it’s out of my control.

I pause a moment, stop to feel
the rippling tree-born skin, 
and wonder how I’ve come so far
but never seem to win.

I kick a stone and watch it tumble
down the mossy banks, 
and for a moment I can almost
hear it whisper thanks.

A bird in song gives me a start
and whistles in my head.
Sharp I rise from battling, 
so wounded yet undead.

But it is still my fate it seems
to wrestle with my mind.
While others just enjoy the view
my thoughts are in a bind.

Alas to see and hear and feel, 
this gift a lovely curse.
I wish, I wish I could ignore
And yet...it could be worse.

So I walk, I keep on walking
it’s my only choice, 
but if I write it, I am free; 
this is my only voice.
