So I've discovered Plotinus.
Have you never heard?
He has shaped your own words.

He is waiting to meet us,
but don't be absurd.
He would never disturb

Your most serious dogmas,
for me put them there.
What a curious bird.

is mystical union
with the Absolute --

is that too much to ask?

Augustine doles out freely
fruits of Temple and Academy
with no thought
for the plants on which they grow.
