Hot and Cold
21 April 2018

*For Peter Dale Scott*

The morning began,
and would end consequentially,

buildings collapsing,
BANG!

We have lived, have we not,
in an age of terror,

By George,
an age of Terror.

I have seen my own soul and felt afraid.

——

It began, of course, 
earlier,

with a bang
down in Dallas,

or Berlin, 1945
and after,

but in any case, it’s ours,
the children.

We are not sure what to love.

——

Cool me, gentle apathy,
with all your mists.

Placate as you vacate,
oh my soul.
