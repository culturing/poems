Somnambulance
05 February 2015

Screams of seven thousand thousand
haunt the seven decades
since they exited throat.

Auschwitz undigested
sticks in throats
generations removed.

We drift in echoes
that cannot be heard,
that pierce if heard.

We have not heard
but drift through echoes and time.

How does one cope?

Before the screams,
there was Darkness;
into Darkness came War,
and Fire began.

Who has not seen the faces?
Who has seen any face?

War consumes Light,
begetting Scream;
congeals to Shadow.

--

We are children of Abram.

Shadow is our womb,
coddling like a cocoon
of darkness.

Have we seen anything?

Battle has moved on.
Convictions make screams
and Law perishes.

Dare we impose?

We wax somnambulant,
Drifting through slumber.

They were like us,
those screaming, and those
making them scream.

Fire burns at back of Mind,

And Blazeless, blinded,
We shiver, huddled in masses,
Fearing sparks.

--

Who will relearn the melody
under the memory,

The song which can bend fire
into warmth, and teach us hope?
