Parting
02 April 2016

Time takes. We weep.
Such tears are not for sorrow,
but for grace --
that we should live at all
to know the embrace --

Alas, parting -- the sweet sorrow --
ever pitted between truth and marrow,
which bends fate, concedes,

And then leaves no trace.

No ducts are so deep
to not swell at endings.

But there are beginnings,
sorrows saved and joys awaiting,
a haunting horizon --

Nay, this is no sheathing
but a brandishing.
