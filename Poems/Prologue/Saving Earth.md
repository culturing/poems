Saving Earth
23 March 2022

We have taken lightning captive,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we have made the sky our slave
on our relentless quest for vengeance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on an Earth we cannot save.

If all is lost, then songs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot be sung, and yet
this song goes on, so all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must still be found somehow.

If we cannot save Earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can Earth save us?
Or is it not a matter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of saving, but of trust?
