After Tomorrow
04 November 2022

I remember from time to time
how those moments when humans
are worse than isolation resolve
into moments when all one can do
is sit quitly, staring off into
tomorrow, as if it won't also
be much like today, and I wonder
what happens the day after tomorrow
when all of us wake up anew.
