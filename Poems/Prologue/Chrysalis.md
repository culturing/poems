Chrysalis
05 March 2021

I sit quiet,
fetal in the void

and what light
comes?

Is it the East?
No, not the East.

It is like morning
after many nights,

and I awake at dawn,
perform my miracles.

This morning (oh what morning),
is it ever to be believed?

Yes,
though not for long,

because eclipse will come
in soon to snuff it out.

And yet still now
this moment, stay with me,

and we will have 
our chrysalis 
in time to speak of things.
