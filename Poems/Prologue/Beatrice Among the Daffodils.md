Beatrice Among the Daffodils
22 July 2019

I see the beloved, dancing
in a field of purest gold.
She is not mine to have or hold.

Her body, like her soul,
is what she is. And these 
together make one whole.

O friend in white!
Come down from heaven,
where the air has grown too thin.

Here are some daffodils.
Your spirit lies within.
