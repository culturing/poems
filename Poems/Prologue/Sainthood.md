Sainthood
05 May 2019

By Hippo’s pearl-white gate we stand,
imbibing every reprimand,
embodied and ashamed, we wait 
for worldless fame and deathless man.

O Sorrow! How forsaken, we,
in dour, lifelong misery,
implore a ghost to hear the cry
of spirit’s flesh-born agony.

O sleeper, wake! and dread no wonder.
Seek Aquino’s shores, and plunder.
World awaits, and those who know
are thus drawn out and under.
