Out of Doors
29 May 2015

He crossed the doorway
one last time.

The hinge, grown stiff,
came to 
and turned.

A vacuum grew
where air had been,

But more rushed in
and clicked in place
from somewhere deep within.

Too long had he suffocated
under indoor air.

Outdoor paths
proposed some inspiration,

So he left,

And going door to door
curled way on way

And found that wind not quite as bold
as it had seemed within,

And he discerned
that inside is something worth grasping.
