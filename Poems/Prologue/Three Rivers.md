Three Rivers
22 September 2016

Until the end has spoken,
until all have been awoken,
until no more tongues are broken

Sing sweet Thames, oh sing sweet Thames.

And by the dusty jailhouse,
by the ladder wracked with stars
and by the tree branch burned with scars

Oh Mississippi sing, oh sing,
oh Mississippi won't you sing.

And like the friendly moon,
and like the trees that live here too,
like able-bodied men who swoon,

Monongahela you must sing.
