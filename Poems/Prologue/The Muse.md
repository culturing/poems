The Muse
22 May 2017

Sing, oh great sleepy Muse, sing.

How we long for the ring
of your voice once to bind us
again to the melodies of life
and the rhythms of death.

There is no joy apart from you,
no pain but parting from you,

There is no song that is not you,
no answer dreamed without you,

So sing, sweet Muse,
do sing.

For else all is an empty thing.
