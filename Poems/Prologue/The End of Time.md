The End of Time
17 October 2016

I sing unto the end of time,
And not of loss or life between.
Beginnings, endings have no rhyme.

I do not walk the line
Toward a promise unforeseen.
I sing unto the end of time,

And hold my breath, for it is mine.
I think the only things are green.
Beginnings, endings have no rhyme,

And dying, it is fine.
Although I prize what lovers dream.
I sing unto the end of time

For lies have made us mean.
At the dawn is no more me.
Sing unto the end of time
If nothing else will rhyme.
