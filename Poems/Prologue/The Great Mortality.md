The Great Mortality (Famine, Death, Rebirth)
26 January 2016

We sow dark energy against our host
With no more remorse, for here the ghost
Drifts sadly before the eyes of none,
Ancient among foregone hills.

*Those who know*

Hope! What is hope?
Sacred thoughts cope,
and merely cope.

*know the ashes know*

Float on, you faithless.
There is time to decompose.

*know the rose*

The ash of genius grows.
