Song
02 May 2016

I have seen beginnings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen my end I have
seen some tomorrows and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've walked behind
the curtain to where
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing lies I've seen 
the ancient hills 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but I could not make out their markings
and I've heard the distant Elves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but are they coming or embarking?

There runs deep a Song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and we have all been taught wrong.

I have listened closely
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have waited near
I've book-learned much and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quavered I have loved
but not enough and I have
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caught the scent of Juniper
I've swooned amid the leaves
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I have tasted bitter Lucifer
in all the bitter leaves.

There runs deep a Song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and we have all been taught wrong.

I have raged and hungered
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have severed
I've torn self from home I've
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cackled I've corroded 
I've disowned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I have been an unborn self alone.

There runs deep a Song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and we have all been taught wrong.

I have seen beginnings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen my end, I've tried 
to sing along, along,

For there runs deep a Song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and we have all been taught it wrong.
