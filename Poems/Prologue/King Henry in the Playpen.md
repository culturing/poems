King Henry in the Playpen
05 March 2019

The Virgin laughs
like a mother whose child
does not know he is seen.

She is recovering
from Plague,
and watches, near flowers,

her little tyrant
storming through his own world.

O silly boy,
your mother waits.

Do you not know her? 

Ah, she laughs so gently,
so as not to weep,

and thinks, “Go on.
Thy rampage is almost done.

You will need me soon.”
