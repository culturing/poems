The End of Suffering
06 August 2016

I've heard that once there was suffering.
One hardly thinks of it now.
Pallbearers took dark bodies away,
And even steeple-bells tolled.

Now these thoughtless mortals
can but burn for lack of shade.

Shadow, rend the heat.
The night is meet.
And devils love conceit.
