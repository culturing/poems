*Light
19 June 2022

At a red light,
when there is no cross-traffic,
a silence deepens
like the space between man and God.

How stupid it feels,
to wait for nothing.

According to some theologians,
God occupies space *above* beings,
and waits for us there,
as the father of light.

But I prefer when the light changes
and things keep moving.
