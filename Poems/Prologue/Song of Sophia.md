*Song of Sophia

#### I. Akrasia

    When there were no depths, I was brought forth,
        When there were no springs abounding with water.

Time slipped, fell
through black holes
to where I dwelt,

Stillborn in a rotting womb,
with histories untold.

I cut my own cord.

Day by day I played 
between Olympian plains
and Horeb,

Learning nothing,

For the ground had been well-tread 
by tanks and wise men
teaching shadows

*HEY
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS JUST IN 
HEY
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ERECTILE  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DYSFUNCTION
HEY 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LOOK 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KITTENS
HEY
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BIKINIS  
HEY
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HAVE YOU SEEN 
HEY
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;YOU THERE ??
HEY
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I LOVE YOU. 
HEY
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LOVE ME <3
HEY*

#### II. Nostoi

    Does not wisdom cry out,
        And understanding lift up her voice?

Thunder roars,
and as a man who pants for water
sees the rock break,

And sees the streams long dried by drought
begin to flow, 
and drinks,

So too I flee the wasteland.

#### III. Paideia

    To you, O men, I call,
        and my voice is to the sons of men.

I gaze upon a field grown ripe with wheat
and feel the warmth of rosy-fingered Dawn
who has not failed to rise. I grip the scythe,

And take upon myself beginnings
and their ends, and find this meaning
*sicut erat in principio.*
