*Resist Nature
11 February 2026

Monotheism clouds our judgments about nature,
suggesting that all powers of nature must be obeyed,
derived as they must be from omnipotent and irresistible Being. 
But nature is often trying to kill us, even though it flows through us too.
Whence comes this opposition? How could the One God
be at odds with itself? More importantly, we *resist* nature
whenever it tries to kill us. This much is common sense.
So are we resisting God? Or choosing between *different* gods?

Nature is full of contradictions.
By now we should not expect otherwise.
We may be forced to choose sides.
Rarely is there one right answer.
