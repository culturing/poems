Feet of Rain
31 August 2022

You learn the way but the way changes.
You walk with feet of rain.
You fear the changing more than the storm.
You sink while looking down.

That is one way of doing it.
Others press in from all sides,
demanding a show. You hesitate,
not being a dancer, not being
at all. The way is through the rain.
You will think you have heard this before.
The words change. Why won't they
stay still? Why can't they remain
as they are? They are not, that is why.
It is as though they never were. The rain
moves through the way...
