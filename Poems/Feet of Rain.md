Feet of Rain
31 August 2022

You learn the way but the way changes.
You walk with feet of rain.
You fear the changing more than the storm.
You sink while looking down.

That is one way of doing it,
but others press in from all sides,
demanding a show. You hesitate,
not being a dancer, not being
at all. The way is through the rain.
You will think you have heard this before,
but the words change. Why won't they
stay still? Why can't they remain? 
They are not, that is why, and they never were.
The rain moves through the way...
