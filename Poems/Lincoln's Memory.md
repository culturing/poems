### Lincoln’s Memory

So favored forms of power \
shall not perish from the earth, \
would you please sing for us, O History, \
about the urgent birth \
of these great, terrible, united States, \
which, though conceived in Liberty, \
did break, some say, that vow?

This nation under God, twice founded, \
ever failing, yet immortal, \
did embark toward the dream of Freedom \
led by that one stout Kentuckian \
who hated much as loved \
and took a promise unfulfilled \
and made it law to bind on all.

This promise, called Equality, \
our hope in days to come, \
arose, O History! through violence, \
and herein lies its song.

—

Twas eighteen-fifty-eight, whereon a Senate seat contended \
led the folks of Illinois to dream they saw a President. \
One Lincoln-not-yet-Deity, preparing for debate, \
stood by a portrait of old Jefferson, to whom he could relate, \
and said,

“Old predecessor tongue with wings, remind me, \
whence came our brave truth, \
that all men are created equal. \
Knew you this in youth?”

To which the painting said, \
“It was a growth of many years, \
first born on England’s hills \
in faithful regicide.”

And Lincoln asked, \
“But had you heard of man’s first disobedience \
and the fruit?“

Came quick reply: \
“Our Massachusetts friends knew of such things, \
but I did hope to purge all superstition, \
and robe God in Nature.”

“Ah, in nature,” Lincoln said.

”That’s right. For all can become noble \
if they’re only left alone.”

Great Lincoln, growing pond’rous, \
stroked his chin \
and paced before the painting, \
murmuring, “If left alone…”

He did not dare to broach the question, \
burned on his and other minds, \
of Slavery, but rather urged this thought: \
“Suppose we find all men not equal. Who’s at fault?”

But there was no reply.

The painting would not speak, \
and Lincoln found his affirmation.

As the sureness grew, \
he pondered long \
and nursed a budding song.

—

This Lincoln after many years \
appeared before the dead \
and spoke the words \
we will not long remember,

for we must not hallow, \
must not consecrate that ground \
where many died and killed.

Thus Lincoln willed, \
and thus we must obey.

—

But Oh, how Declaration \
had sent shocks across the sea \
as Mr. Jefferson endeavored \
to give ground to that new plea \
which was come forth just then, \
at last!

And when ‘twas time for tea in Boston, \
there was Paine in every head, \
and ‘twas ideas, sir, ideas! \
which would leave so many dead.

—

Lord, such war and terror \
bled from North down through the South \
until the only ones remaining \
banished God and punished doubt.

To devastation wrought, \
and to the horror not quite heeded,

To man’s ultimate obedience, \
friend History, give song.
