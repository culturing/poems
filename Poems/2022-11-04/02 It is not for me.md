It is not for me
04 November 2022

Here they are, as ever, making the weaker
argument appear stronger, uneven in thinking,
so tipsy in mind. What great folly, if even
the end of historic progressions or else
the result of some King's stiff command.
We are tired by now and its restlessness,
drawn to all corners of the imagination
by a call no less real than a fairy-tale
and no more real than the earth. It has
drained us of every ambition, but this
is no reason to scream, no, the screaming
is part of the problem. I ask you for once
to be ruled, if you will, if you can,
but it is not for me that I'm asking.
