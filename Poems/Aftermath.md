Aftermath
21 April 2018

I have heard the wild
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ramblings,
felt betrayed by man
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and steel,
and I cannot 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keep on 
good clothes —

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but madly naked
run through city streets,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cry “Kung Fu Tze!
where are you?”
