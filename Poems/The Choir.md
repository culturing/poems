By silent seas we sit and sing\
Of life's unwrought enamelling\
As each day gathers into storm\
And reasons with our untold ire.

Rise fair song and banish woe\
For we must fear the foreman’s blow\
For though our fathers built with stone\
We build the world again each morn,

And tremble in the shade of steel,\
And ache for poison salesmen sell,\
And whirl in this ungrateful gyre\
To placate pioneering fire.

--

What is this? What is my own?\
What good is a peopled home\
When urge and urge and urge inspire\
Epitomes forlorn?

Hope, where are your lovely feathers?\
All your crumbs are swept -- this weathered\
Leaf deceives -- these grasses wither.\
There are only bog and mire.

Who would dare to ope\
Pandora's vessel once again? What's left?\
All can see that Zeus has scorned\
Those Foresight has adorned.

--

But summon those old voices hither.\
Sing some song against the dither.\
Won’t a mythic world reborn\
Reclassify revealed desire?

Make again that age-old beat.\
Forget the words that spell defeat.\
Abandon prod and thrust.\
Embrace the courage of the calling horn.

For we have feared the shades of steel,\
But harbor dreams of living well,\
And dream of lifting off this pyre,\
And lift this chorus as a choir.
