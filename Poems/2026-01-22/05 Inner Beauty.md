        That we must labor to be beautiful

The labor is much appreciated, although it's not always required,
because the thoughtful can remember and interpret at a glance,
having once glimpsed inner beauty in the light of day.
They cannot erase its indelible mark from the mind's eye,
and they'll know that it slumbers within even when
outward labors are lacking. So take heart, born woman,
and fear not your lover's neglect. If he loves you,
he could not forget if he tried.
