*Room For Doubts
22 January 2026

A strange calm echoes the silence both in and out.
I am hoping to see you, but whether this hope comes true
is up to you. It is out of my hands. I believe I've received
your instructions, and I will obey, but I cannot say
quite how I feel, like a moment's hesitation before a storm.
So go, if you must, and move on. But I have room for doubts.
I have room for you and your doubts.
