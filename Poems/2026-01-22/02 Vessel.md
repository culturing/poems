Vessel
22 January 2026

Darling, let me tell you why my heart sings.
It is not because of you. It is because the sun
shines love anew and echoes with the sweet refrain
that banishes the rain. Oh, it is true, but it's a truth
we carry, each of us, just waiting to poke through.
I turn to you (I do), but as it stands,
you are no source of truth, but only truth's true vessel,
as am I. Let love remember whence it comes.
