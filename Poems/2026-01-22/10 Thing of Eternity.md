Thing of Eternity
22 January 2026

What use in protesting it? See, I am here, I will love
if love does come my way...but I have not forgotten our folly.
The whole human race live like puppets, awaiting a tug on the strings,
without which we grow cold and limp, and more useless
than rotting wood. But the puppet master has no mercy,
does not wait for the opportune time...still, *is* there 
an opportune time? Or is love not a thing of time, but always
a thing of eternity?
