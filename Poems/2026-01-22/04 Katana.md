It is a great gift to know that I can flatter you to no end,
that you will cut through the false ones, receiving only the true.
It will be a great help to me. No lesser mind will do. I require
one sharp as a katana and precise as a samurai, slicing 
through my weak points, with care, but with no remorse,
for your blade is true.
