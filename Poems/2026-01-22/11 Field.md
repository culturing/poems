*Field
22 January 2026

Into your eternal bosom, let me come and rest,
that we might find ourselves enlightened and immured
by what beats in your breast. You are the field, and I
the meager cultivator, making plans and plowing
so that you might come to life. You nourish both of us
and all who know your bounty. I will take good care
to keep you fed and watered, add a trellis here and there,
but you know what to do, and you know how to do it, more than I. 
You are the field, as yet untapped, but overflowing with potential.
