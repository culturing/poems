*Intuition
22 January 2026

You've come. No, not in real life, in that realer life,
the life of dreams, which says to me, "she's come," that now
it's a matter of time. How can I know such things?
There's no new *evidence*, unless I count this feeling,
intuition, surer guide than eyes or ears in the jungles of love.
Why do I *know* it with conviction? It can only be the simple truth,
we are now one already, in some way we could neither cause
nor resist. But do not be afraid. Love has its purposes,
and we do well to go where it would take us.
