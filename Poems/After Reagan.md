We have been pre-sliced  
individually, wrapped in money.  

But oh, he was funny, well-spoken, and phony.  
A pity so few will remember  
the lens of that time,  
or look through it to see  
what might be.  

Are we free?  

I have heard so much talk about liberty,  
so little wondering,  
"what does that mean?"  
that I wonder,  
is Freedom for me?  

And does Freedom need me?
