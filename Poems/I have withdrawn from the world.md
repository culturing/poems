I have withdrawn from the world  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the world’s own good,  
I have bound my own hands.

But not with the usual cords  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and knots,  
not well-fashioned marriage bands.

I come for the darkness,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and whisper it slow:  
that this is where all the young tulips go

Which have failed to grow  
in dead soil.

—

Whence comes new song,  
and will it be long?

The embers are dwindling,  
the hearth has grown cold,  
and the vagabonds grow old.

I say only this,  
that is this not sure bliss,  
to belong, to behold, and to bless?
