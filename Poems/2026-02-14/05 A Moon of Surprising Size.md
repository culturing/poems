*A Moon of Surprising Size
14 February 2026

So many things that I've wanted to share with you 
have come and gone, but there will be more.
I don't know what you are waiting for, but I trust
that you know, that you'll know it when you feel it.
I must not *wait* in the sense of forgoing other opportunities,
but I find no other who moves me like you do.
I simply exist in a world which (I now know) contains you.
Let this sweetness linger. Consider it, as one considers a moon
of surprising size, just above the horizon.
