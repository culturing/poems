Kennedy's Peace
23 September 2023

Thoughts go once more to John Kennedy,
thoughts that were lost, only here to revive
through abstraction the dream of world peace,
international dream, silly dream in the final analysis,
lost as man is in identities, cages of spirit,
and yet through the din of the bombs I can hear it
speak clearly and truly that something has got to change.
Oh, that change never comes (surely never)
which brings peace on earth while men live, 'til men leave it,
but change in our stars has arrived from the east
which may free us for both peace and war.

The peace movement has its Christ
and awaits its Constantine.
