*A Typical Day
23 September 2023

On a typical day, all the typical people
go down to the river to play, the most
normal of folk, acting normally, day by day.
But outside of the current one stands
on firm ground, with strong legs, and skips rocks
to learn how much the current can say,
and to test its vibrations for permanence,
longing for such, disappointed so far,
one who knows one must learn in this way,
because soon comes a time of the flood,
and somebody must watch night and day.
