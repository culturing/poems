*Through the Horizon
23 September 2023

First day on the job, I walked
into the factory, noticed the machines
did not want me, and left. The pay
was extraordinary, but ended abruptly
as soon as they saw that some part
of myself was impervious to their 
designs, having been forged by time 
and not dreamed in a fit of industrialization. 
But what ended exactly? I found,
as the door closed behind me, a new 
sense of purpose, and tasted fresh salt
in the air, though I didn't look back,
and I'll never forget how the sun felt
that first day of freedom, or how it fell
through the horizon, like so many times before.
