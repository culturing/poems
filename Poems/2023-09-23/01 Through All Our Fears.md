*Through All Our Fears
23 September 2023

I have found my way now to the nether regions,
all those dark places beyond all prevailing conventions,
where silence rules and where strange plants grow.
I am writing to you with a vision long seen
but just recently put into words. I have heard you 
are eager for change, but that's what I know well,
and it's never quite what you'd expect. Listen closely.
The only way through is on *your* legs, with blood
pumped by *your* heart, which comes from your parents.
There is no deeper mystery than why we abide together,
despite all our squabbling, despite all our fears.
