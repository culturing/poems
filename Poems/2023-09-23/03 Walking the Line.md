*Walking the Line
23 September 2023

From the darkness, a leader
would sometimes emerge to remind
of original covenants, binding through time,
but I have not the mind to dispute
the dark facts, nor the heart to unwind
the calf caught in the web. No, they come
from another direction, the province of vanity,
soured by years of neglect in an empire
of vanity chasing vanity. Whence, then,
this song? From the light? What light dares
to escape the embrace of a vanity
cherished by all in the depths of their souls?
Only this little light of mine, only this,
throughout time, to the ends of the mind
and back here, of this essence, here 
walking the line.
