*Chiaroscuro Girl
29 October 2025

The mind wants what it wants
and the body does too, but she knows
too much about love, about life,
to believe in the easy reunion
of anima and animus. She sees
the twinkle of dwindling thoughts,
the cool space in between our beliefs,
and she likes it there, under the ground,
where a seed might be planted.
She dwells not by choice
but by nature at twilight,
in a world of chiaroscuro,
as a chiaroscuro girl.
