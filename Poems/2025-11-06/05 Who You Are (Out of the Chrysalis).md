*Who You Are (Out of the Chrysalis)
06 November 2025

Is there really a sun, or are we
in the dark, full of vaguely imagined
illumination? If tomorrow comes, let it come swift
and sudden, not drawn out, prolonged
by the doubting moon. Into essence
light peers, bathing hidden things,
and unveiling sleeping beauties now ready
for light of day. So arise and make good
this potential for goodness. Awaken from dreams
and live in your newfound reality.

Hold your head high and look forward.
This is who you are.
