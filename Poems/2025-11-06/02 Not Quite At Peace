Not Quite At Peace
06 November 2025

Would there ever be an end to it
or must it be carried like a burden,
the rush of the earth and eternal desire
subsuming all good sense and order?
Can reason win? But how could it lose?
If mind be understood as a function of body,
and body of nature, then is there a difference?
Or is this yin/yang, nomos/physis, male/female, form/matter
not a conflict of opposites, but only
the tensions of a living thing? The struggle
is everlasting, and all find a place in it.
There is no other place. Time goes on,
and life with it, and life, it appears,
is not quite at peace with itself.
