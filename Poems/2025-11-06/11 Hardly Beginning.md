*Hardly Beginning
06 November 2025

Birth, after all, is a death sentence, bringing
Pandora's whirlwind to life. Is it somber to doubt
my own wisdom, forged in the fires of experience?
There is no better wisdom, and no truer goal
than a life lived completely aware of that life.
I'll walk on. The next chapter is hardly beginning.
