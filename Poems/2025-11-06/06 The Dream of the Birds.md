*The Dream of the Birds
06 November 2025

It was never the way it was, it was
always evolving, from one thing to the next,
and our folly was hoping to make it stand still.
By the window I stood and gazed long
at the birds in the widening sun. They flew higher
than I could, but somehow they did not get singed.
Only later I learned they felt empty,
deprived of solid ground. It was never that way, though,
not really, for only in the dream of the birds
such thoughts roost. I once dreamed of flying too,
but now I think ground suits my feet,
and besides, there are worms to eat,
and our hunger for worms is unquenched.
