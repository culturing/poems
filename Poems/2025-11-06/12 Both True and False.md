Both True and False
06 November 2025

I recognized something that felt like home,
but I never got the chance to prove it,
or maybe I proved it but not in a safe way,
but what love is safe? At least heartbreak is possible,
no matter the level of care. It's a strange thing
to know love is both true and false.
