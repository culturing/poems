Not Too Soon
06 November 2025

Was I really in earnest, and really awaiting new love,
or instead just awaiting the muse of love
to rekindle my dying flame? All the same,
I have closed the door, just like all times before,
because love does not suit my true nature.
But of course it's a complex nature, overflowing
with hopes and desires despite inability
to see them through. And this will never change.
But at least I at last ran this simulation
all the way through to the end, cleared the cobwebs
and mopped the floor of my heart, just in case.
So as she takes her place in the chorus of failed loves,
I can stand a little taller, with a sense of wholeness.
Who knows when another love comes, but I hope it will be
not too soon.
