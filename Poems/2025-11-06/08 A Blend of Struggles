A Blend of Struggles
06 November 2025

I am now neither lover nor teacher nor even friend,
but mere stranger. How strange to be cast as a Nothing
in my own story, adrift in the ensemble,
which calls to the hero but does not have any effect.
If in time hope must die, and I with it,
let this serve as my reminder that life
is a blend of struggles, overlapping
but not intersecting, orthogonal to each other
and to the whole.
