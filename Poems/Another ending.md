### Another ending

I guess this is the end.\
I'm not sure what of. \
They say time is no friend.\
Things slip away.

I guess it must be so.\
But how should we know?\
Something moves about,\
and I can hear it rumble now.

So I write this down.\
Embark with me I pray.\
Other thoughts have flown,\
or gone some other way,

But within is the promised stay of woe,\
and that is where the old roads go.
