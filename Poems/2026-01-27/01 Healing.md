Healing
27 January 2026

How far we have come, and how far
we have yet to go...what is this sudden pain
and these memories? Minerva's owl at dusk?
I think an old wound is healing. I think
it will itch for a while. We are closer
than ever before, and that makes healing
possible. Heal me, and let me heal you.
