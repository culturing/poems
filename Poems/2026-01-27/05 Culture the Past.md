*Culture the Past
27 January 2026

The past, it turns out, is easy to destroy,
but the future is hard to build. What happens
when the future fails to arrive? Are we left
with nothing, or can we rebuild what we had?
The past, in fact, still lingers, though it moves
underground, to avoid the prurient fingers
of scientists and politicians. I would let it
evolve, and seek neither to destroy nor to build 
ex nihilo, but culture the past into something
we all could live for.
