*Am I Right?
16 December 2025

Am I right? Or have I pushed too far, dreamed too much,
put my fingers where they don't belong? You are stronger than you think,
I'm convinced of it, and it seems only a matter of time
until you prove it. But you must prove it for you, not for me,
only if and because it *is* what you are, and until you can say what you need,
until you can name your desires, you are not ready for them, because,
I can tell you, naming is not the hard part. Taming will be much harder,
so much so that many dare not to attempt it. But you are attempting already,
and that sets you off as a rare bird, a stranger even, but I see a budding master
of the art of humanity, one who won't settle for easy answers to easy questions
but only for truth, however painful. This courage is rare, as you surely must know,
but we share it, and that means you dazzle me, in both heart and mind,
and it takes all I have to not start right now, but that would not be wise,
and we must be wise. If we start too soon, it might end your development
here and now, a development that only can happen alone.
So we wait. I will not give you cause to resent me
by holding you back. You are free to develop into what you are,
and bound, I suspect, by no other law. But you *are* bound
by nature, though nature and law can be friends, when law learns
to be gentle and nature learns that some boundaries
serve a good purpose and need not be torn down.
