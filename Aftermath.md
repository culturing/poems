### Aftermath

I have heard the wild\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ramblings,\
felt betrayed by man\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and steel,\
and I cannot \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keep on \
good clothes —

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but madly naked\
run through city streets,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cry “Kung Fu Tze!\
where are you?”
