Reasonable Measure
16 July 2022

At the end of life's journey
I awoke, not aware yet
of where my road had taken me,
but brightness lit my mind up
like a flame. I'll never be the same.
Discursive Reason failed us. Here we wait
for some new measure to make chaos
something straight, without demanding
that it wear the guise of form.
I beg to differ, if by differing
I bring new thoughts to table,
and as far as I am able,
guide our way. But beggars all
would trade their place for one
in heaven, yet to me that path is barred,
so I use reason in new ways,
feet deep in earth, head free of daemons,
closing in on what it means to be here now,
where I awoke, at journey's end.

Across the sea, I glimpse an image,
be it shade or beast or otherwise,
I only know its visage.
But it calls me with its message,
like a work of human craft.
I say, deception is insidious.
I tell this lonesome image
to release my gaze to this shore,
where I make my only home.

But what home is, I cannot say,
nor can this homely image tell me.
