Screams of seven thousand thousand  
haunt the seven decades  
since they exited throat.  

Auschwitz undigested  
sticks in throats  
generations removed.  

We drift in echoes  
that cannot be heard,  
that pierce if heard.  

We have not heard  
but drift through echoes and time.  

How does one cope?  

Before the screams,  
there was Darkness;  
into Darkness came War,  
and Fire began.  

Who has not seen the faces?  
Who has seen any face?  

War consumes Light,  
begetting Scream;  
congeals to Shadow.  

-

We are children of Abram.  

Shadow is our womb,  
coddling like a cocoon  
of darkness.  

Have we seen anything?  

Battle has moved on.  
Convictions make screams  
and Law perishes.  

Dare we impose?  

We wax somnambulant,  
Drifting through slumber.  

They were like us,  
those screaming, and those  
making them scream.  

Fire burns at back of Mind,  

And Blazeless, blinded,  
We shiver, huddled in masses,  
Fearing sparks.  

-


Who will relearn the melody  
under the memory,  

The song which can bend fire  
into warmth, and teach us hope?
