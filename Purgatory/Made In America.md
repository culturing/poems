Made In America
24 May 2017

*For Allen Ginsberg and against many others*

America I've given you my mind and now know nothing.
America have you lost it?
America let's come together.
America the times have changed.
America I have nine Facebook friends.
I text them all the time.
America is this what you meant?
Sorry if I'm oppressing you.
Sometimes I eat cholesterol.
I just can't relax.

America I spent twelve years staring at tile growing limp you paid for it nobody noticed is this Progress?

America are we There yet?

America where do Rights come from?
I've turned off my mind but I won't float downstream.
America why Columbine?
America why Ted Kaszynski?
America have you tried thinking about it?
It must be those damn video games.
America this is a problem.
We'd better get out and protest.
America it’s those damn liberals.
America it’s those damn conservatives.
America I can't believe you.

America I won't watch television.
You really can't be serious.
Three minutes is not enough time.

America millions of kids have no clue about meaningful conversations after years in your schools. I guess they need more Science.

America it confuses me when you bully me into tolerance.
I begin to doubt your sincerity.
America why do you hate the dead?
Are handicapped people more equal than me?
America help I feel alienated.
America this is my inside voice.
America have you read the Bible?
America it has sex in it.
I mean that literally.
America what is the meaning of this?
America why so many pills?
America let's be friends.

America I'm getting anxious.
America is this the end?
America why are your shelves full of poison?
America I don't like corn.
I almost have my energies aligned.
But why is there so much pornography?

America I had a dream that when I grew up I would be strong and capable now I'm not so sure.

America I'm not finished can I have an extension?
